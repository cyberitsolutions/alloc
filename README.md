## Installation

#### NOTE: If you are upgrading, please read the _Upgrading_ section below.

allocPSA is generally intended to run with PHP>=5 and MySQL>=4 on a
Linux server. It possibly runs on a Windows box, but is untested.

You will need to install php, mysql, and php-mbstring. The php-gd
package is also recommended. On Debian, this will get all that is
needed:

```
# apt-get install apache2 php php-mysql php-mbstring php-gd mariadb-server make python
```

Ensure mariadb is running in utf8 mode and not utf8mb4, see the config
files for mariadb in /etc/.

To install allocPSA:

1) Put the allocPSA source code in a directory called e.g. `alloc` in your
httpd servers document root. E.g.: `/var/www/html/alloc/`

2) Make the patches and css, e.g.:

```
$ make patches; make css
```

3) In a web browser, go to your servers hostname + directory where you put the
alloc source code, such as: `http://localhost/alloc/`

4) Follow the instructions in the web browser to complete the installation.

## Upgrading

### Generic Upgrade Instructions

- Backup your allocPSA database. _DO IT NOW_.
- Unpack the new allocPSA source code alongside your current installation.
- Copy the `alloc_config.php` file from your current installation of
  allocPSA into the directory that contains the new installation of allocPSA.

- Finally, update your allocPSA database by going to this address in your web
  browser: `http://YOUR_NEW_ALLOC_INSTALLATION/installation/patch.php`

  Apply each patch separately, starting from the top and working your way
  down. If you get errors stop the process and use the support forums.
