allocPSA Installation
=====================

functionality.

To install allocPSA:

   httpd servers document root. E.g.: /var/www/html/alloc/

2) Make the patches and css, e.g.:

    $ make patches; make css

3) In a web browser, go to your servers hostname + directory where you put the
   alloc source code, such as: http://localhost/alloc/

4) Follow the instructions in the web browser to complete the installation.
