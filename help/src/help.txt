Product Support Community
=========================

Free, community support for allocPSA is available here:

http://sourceforge.net/p/allocpsa/discussion/

This is a web forum system where you can join, post your queries and get
responses from the allocPSA user community.

Product Support Commercial
==========================

allocPSA is free, open source software. As such, you are free to use it in any
manner you like. This includes:

#.  Installing and using allocPSA in a commercial environment,

#.  Installing and using allocPSA on as many computers or servers as you like,
    and

#.  Having allocPSA accessed and used by as many users as you like.

If you have the technical skill in-house or can hire them, you may be happy to
support and maintain this product on your own. However, allocPSA is developed
and commercially supported by Cyber IT Solutions Pty. Ltd., based in Melbourne,
Australia.

Cyber IT Solutions has been providing commercial support since 1991 and has
been the allocPSA product developer and maintainer since 2000. As such, we can
offer your firm high-quality support. In addition, because allocPSA is open
source software, and any other competent web-development firm can also elect to
offer commercial support for it, Cyber IT Solutions must also offer great value
in its support services.

Customization
-------------

No two businesses work the same way. To provide for this reality, allocPSA was
designed and is intended to be customized for each site. To that end, Cyber IT
Solutions offers your firm a complete customization service, whereby allocPSA
can be optimized for your work processes, your firm's accounting and billing
practices and the software used to implement these, or any other site-specific
requirements.

If allocPSA does most of what your business needs but could benefit from
specific functionality to make it better integrate with your existing business
systems or processes, speak to us about a free quote to add those features into
allocPSA.

Alternatively, as allocPSA is completely open source, you can elect to make any
modifications in-house, or hire a third-party to make any modifications. You
are fully entitled to select either course of action.

Making Your Own Customizations
------------------------------

As allocPSA is released under an Open Source license, the GNU Affero General
Public License, you are welcome to make your own site-specific customizations.
However, the license requires that you must provide the capability for your
end-users and the people that you re-distribute your changes to, to access the
source code to your modifications as well, thereby affording them the same
freedoms that you have enjoyed. Please note that there is an "allocPSA Source
Code" viewer in the Tools menu.

If you do build extensions onto allocPSA, please consider donating these back
to the allocPSA project. This will provide two benefits:

#.  You will be making a contribution back to the community, so that allocPSA
    grows in capabilities and polish, with time.

#.  You will reduce your level of burden by feeding your code changes back up
    stream, you will let the project maintainers maintain your modified
    codebase, ensuring that new versions include the features you want and that
    these continue to work with the other new as well as the existing features
    in newer versions of allocPSA.

Integration
-----------

Cyber IT maintains a full integration, support and development team which is
able to assist you in integrating allocPSA into your organization's information
system architecture.


Online Web Hosting
------------------

Cyber IT Solutions in partnership with ALSG is now proud to offer online
hosting of the allocPSA application. For more information see

Introduction
============

Welcome to the user-level documentation for allocPSA.

allocPSA is an on-line, web-based Professional Services Automation system.
allocPSA provides a suite of integrated applications designed for organizations
which provide services to Clients. It enables services personnel to become more
productive and profitable by increasing their efficiency through increased
utilisation and productive time, improved planning and integrated knowledge
management. It reduces the likelihood of slip-ups and increases the
traceability and manageability of projects, expenses, Tasks and people.

allocPSA can streamline the process of allocating staff resources to key
projects, managing strategic initiatives at a granular level, and can offer a
platform for process collaboration and knowledge reuse to any professional
services business.

allocPSA consists of numerous software modules for business areas such as:
resource planning, project management, time and expenses management, fault &
issues tracking, messages, announcements, reminders, knowledge management,
collaboration, services supply chain, human resources, staff skills,
certification, item loans, and management of cost-centres. allocPSA offers
integration between the modules, as well as an open architecture and
integration with existing external invoicing, book-keeping, and payroll
systems.

allocPSA is intended for use in daily organizational operations, such as
client contact, project management, task and resource allocation, skills
tracking, time-sheeting, issues tracking, calendaring, reminders and
escalation, item loans, cost expenses and centres as well as integration with
existing external accounts and billing systems.

allocPSA is made available as a server-based appliance. By deploying an
allocPSA system into your network, all staff can access the application from
any networked computer which has a web browser. Depending on your network
configuration and security policies, staff can also access the allocPSA system
from external computers. Therefore, they can monitor Tasks and submit
Time Sheets from home, or from any Internet-access point around the world.

As a web-based application, users access allocPSA via the standard web-browser
they already have on their PCs. No software needs to be installed on their PCs.
Installation and maintenance of allocPSA is therefore a simple and
straightforward affair. A new server is installed and configured in hours and
all users' PCs are able to access the allocPSA application immediately.

allocPSA is open source software - you are provided with full access to the
complete source code under an open source licence. That means you have
open-ended usage and code modification access rights. This greatly reduces your
business risks in adopting allocPSA as a system element in your core business
operations. The product's source code will always be yours in perpetual code
escrow, at no additional cost.

Deployment
----------

allocPSA is supplied in a number of 'formats', you can:

#.  Download it from http://www.allocpsa.org/ which will need to be installed
    on a web application server.

#.  Buy a paid hosted service available from http://www.allocpsa.com/


Installation and Configuration
==============================

Once you've installed allocPSA, you must login and then change the default
login account password. You can do this by accessing the default account
through the People tab and supplying a new strong account password.

You should also update the allocPSA configuration settings, found by clicking
the 'Setup' link in the top right hand corner of the allocPSA toolbar. You can
get more information about each configuration item, by using the Help squares
to the right of each configuration option.

Update the allocPSA configuration information as soon as you can.


Features & Benefits
===================

Modern businesses are quickly recognizing the need to make intelligent use of
information throughout the organization to better address support issues and
other business problems. allocPSA can help track and manage customer requests,
problems, complaints, Tasks and any other projects that need to be tracked.
Web-based action tracking offers the best and most simple way to gain control
over information, issues and Tasks for a group or department, or throughout an
organization worldwide.

With the increasing business requirement that information management systems
provide substantial and immediate return on investment, allocPSA is the answer
to many of your service-industry information management concerns.

Among other features, allocPSA provides a comprehensive multilevel,
multi-project planning, scheduling and reporting engine scalable to thousands
of projects. The ability to search for qualified and available resources,
assign Tasks and manage staff with a powerful resource search engine across
single or multiple projects.

allocPSA also offers cost-control management and project graphical and
milestone-enabled Gantt-style bar chart reporting capabilities. This makes
allocPSA a valuable platform for managing the priorities and objectives that
drive your business.

Using proven project management disciplines and processes, allocPSA helps you
optimize resources and manage activities to meet project deadlines and budgets.

allocPSA automatically generates customizable outgoing email alerts to
instantly notify relevant assignees, managers and other people involved with
all aspects of service delivery. Daily email alerts, sent to all resources,
outlines that day's key Tasks and scheduled events, meetings and expectations.

A Task and reminder Calendar is available for all staff on entry into allocPSA,
via the Home page.

A filtering drill-down facility to resource (personnel) availability and
skills makes it possible to determine which of your staff is suited for
particular Project and Tasks.

allocPSA provides a simple inventory and loans management module, a framework
for producing Project cost-estimators, a graphical chart representation of
historical and current business activity, as well as an open-ended and
customisable report generator which allows you to extract data to a web-page or
CSV file, ready for mail-merges or exporting.

How to Accomplish Common Tasks
==============================


How do I Log In?
----------------

.. figure:: images/login.png

    This is the allocPSA log in screen


In order to gain access to allocPSA, you will need the allocPSA administrator
to create an account for you, and to assign you a password. You can then enter
the username and your password in the login screen of allocPSA, as shown here.

When you point your web-browser to the URL which contains allocPSA, you
should see the Login screen. Enter your username and your password, then click
on the Login button. allocPSA should then take you to the main allocPSA Home
page.


How do I Review Update/Changelog Information?
---------------------------------------------

If allocPSA has undergone a recent version update or had patches
applied, information about those changes (the changelog) will appear on
the login page.

You can also access the changelog by going to Tools > Deployment Changelog.


How do I Recover My Lost Password?
----------------------------------

.. figure:: images/forgot_pass.png

    If you've forgotten your password, have a new one sent to you..

If you have forgotten or misplaced your password, you are able to get allocPSA
to send you another password by clicking on the 'New Password' link, which will
bring up a form for you to supply details to.

allocPSA will only email you a password if you supply the same email address
and username in this form that have been specified previously for that
user in allocPSA.


How do I Logout?
----------------

There is a Logout link in the top right hand corner which will log you out
immediately. For security reasons, allocPSA will automatically time-out your
login session, if you are inactive for a period. If you go out to lunch
etc. when you next come to use allocPSA, you will be presented with the Login
screen from above, and asked to re-authenticate. Note that you can change this
'timeout' period for inactivity from the Setup section of allocPSA.


How do I Add New Users?
-----------------------

In order for your staff or personnel to use allocPSA, they will need accounts
on the system. To create an account, you follow these steps.

#.  Log into allocPSA as an administrator.

#.  Click on the 'People' tab, then click 'New Person'.

#.  Fill in the form. At bare minimum, a username, password (+ password
    confirmation) and if your new user has special privileges, add them from the
    'Special Permissions' selection list. In general, for normal users, no
    special permissions need to be given.

#.  Click the 'Save' button near the bottom.


How do I Create a New Project?
------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Go to the 'Projects' tab and click 'New Project'.

#.  What you will see is the form you need to fill out to create this Project's
    header. Once done, you can add additional Project components.

#.  If this Project is for a Client which hasn't been added in allocPSA
    beforehand, you will need to add that Client. You can do this either by
    using the steps outlined in this section on Adding a New Client, or by
    clicking the 'New Client' link in the Project Details form, and following
    the same steps.

#.  Select the Client contact for that Client, for this Project.

#.  Choose the priority, status and type of Project from the drop list, set the
    Project's manager for Time Sheet purposes etc.

#.  Press 'Save' button.

#.  You are now able to add Project comments, commissions, Project resources,
    reminders, Time Sheets, attachments etc.


How do I Create a New Task?
---------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the 'Tasks' tab and select New Task.

#.  What you see is the Task header section of the form. Fill in this form,
    selecting from the droplists which Project you want this Task to belong to.

#.  If the Task is important or critical, remember to reflect this in
    the Task priority droplist (i.e., change the Normal setting to an
    alternative.)

#.  If you want an automated Reminder to be sent to the Task, click
    the optional checkbox near the bottom of the form ('Create reminder for
    assignee'). Depending on the priority established for this Task,
    the Reminder created will have a longer or shorter repeat
    periodicity. An urgent Task will result in more frequently
    repeating reminders.

#.  Click the Save button.

#.  Your Task header is now saved, and you can update the Task with new
    comments, percentages complete etc.

#.  You can always edit the Task header (to change the name, start dates,
    resource allocation etc.) by clicking on the 'Edit' link at the
    Task.

How do I Create a New Phone Message?
------------------------------------

Sometimes you get a call for someone else in the office, but that person has
gone out to get supplies or something. So you write a note for said person to
ring back, but you forget to tell him. This is what Phone Messages are for,
instead of writing a note that gets forgotten about, write a Phone Message that
reminds the person responsible to ring back.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  From the action Quick List (the Quick List usually has 'Search Tasks'
    written in it) on the allocPSA toolbar, select New Message.

#.  What you see is the Message header section of the form. Fill in this form,
    selecting from the droplists which Project you want this Message Task
    to belong to, if any. Not selecting a parent Project isn't a problem.
    The Message will still appear in the intended recipient's Home page as
    a message.

#.  If the Message is important or critical, remember to reflect this in
    the Message priority droplist (i.e., change the Normal setting to an
    alternative.)

#.  If you want an automated Reminder to be sent to the Message, click
    the optional checkbox near the bottom of the form ('Create reminder for
    assignee'). Depending on the priority established for this Message,
    the Reminder created will have a longer or shorter repeat
    periodicity. An urgent Message will result in more frequently
    repeating reminders.

#.  Click the Save button.

#.  Your Task header is now saved, and you can update the Task with new
    comments, percentages complete etc.

#.  You can always edit the Task header (to change the name, start dates,
    resource allocation etc.) by clicking on the 'Edit' link at the
    Task.


How do I Add an Appointment?
----------------------------

An appointment is actually a Task with an optional reminder. We'll assume that
you have already created a new Task which is a meeting with somebody at a
particular time and place. Then, an appointment is created by the following
steps.

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Locate and click on the Task that relates to the proposed meeting Task on
    the 'Task Calendar'.

#.  It is recommended that the Task name should contain the contact person, the
    time and the place.

#.  Click 'New Reminder' located on the 'Reminder' section of the Task

#.  Select the Date, Time, Recurring and Advanced notice needed according to
    your requirements of the meeting like location, dress code, the time
    required to arrive.

#.  Press 'Save' button

#.  If you now go to the 'Task Calendar' of the 'Home' page again, you should
    find there is a new reminder for that meeting.

.. HINT:: It is a good idea, when creating a meeting Task, to give it a name
          which includes information about who, what, when and where. Here's an
          example: Meeting with Yvonne Smith (Partek Partners) to discuss
          support issues.  Office, Tuesday, 10am'

How do I Add a Meeting Reminder?
--------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  From the action Quick List drop list on the allocPSA toolbar, select 'New
    Reminder'

#.  Give it a name, description, recipients, and when.

#.  Set the advanced notice and recurring every as you so desire.

#.  Press 'Save' button.

How do I Re-Edit a Task's Name?
-------------------------------

#.  Once a Task header has been created, it is not normally available for
    editing. You can follow these steps to make the header accessible again.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  From the toolbar, select 'Tasks'.

#.  Select the Task you want to edit from the 'Task Summary' Table

#.  Click 'Edit' button at the bottom of the screen.

#.  Edit the name or any other aspect of the Task.

#.  Press 'Save' button at the bottom


How do I Delete a Task?
-----------------------

.. NOTE:: It is not possible to delete a task that already has comment,
          time, etc. on it.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  From the toolbar, press 'Tasks'.

#.  Select the Task you want to delete from the 'Task Summary' list.

#.  Press the 'Edit' button, then press the 'Delete' button.

#.  A dialog-box will appear asking you 'Are you sure to delete this record?',
    press 'OK' to confirm the deletion of the Task.

.. NOTE:: It is generally good practice *not* to delete data (like tasks) from
          allocPSA. If you want to make it so that a particular task is no
          longer 'visible' in day-to-day usage, it is best to edit the task,
          and to mark it as being Closed or Pending. You can make this change
          from the Status drop-list of the task header.


How do I Create a New Time Sheet?
---------------------------------

.. NOTE:: In order to create a time sheet, you really need to have created a
          project and task(s) first.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the 'Tasks' tab and choose the task you want to time sheet on.

#.  Click 'Time Sheet'.

#.  A new time sheet is created, or if there is already one you have been using
    for that task, it will be used instead.

#.  Press the 'Save' button to continue or 'Delete' to delete this Time Sheet.

#.  Time Sheets are made up of individual line items, pertaining to specific
    Tasks. For instance, you may have worked for 3 hours on one problem (Task
    A), 2 hours on Task B and 1 hour on Task C, all for the one Client.

#.  For each Time Sheet line item, fill in Date, Duration, Task and Location.

#.  Press the 'Add Time Sheet Item' button to add each new line item.

#.  Repeat step 7 to add more line item entries if needed.

#.  Press 'Time Sheet to Admin' button when done. An email will be sent off to
    the person designated as the next stop in the Time Sheet workflow process.

.. HINT:: You can save the Time Sheet as-is, then return to it later on.

.. HINT:: You can track the progress of your Time Sheets from the 'Time Sheet'
          section of your 'Homepage'.

.. HINT:: If you're a manager designated to receive requests to authorise Time
          Sheets, you can view them from the 'Time Sheet' section of your
          'Homepage'.

How do I Ensure Staff Effort on Tasks is Captured as Time Sheets?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: allocPSA provides managers with the ability to add small comments (or
          hints) to specific tasks, to assist them in tracking the work levels
          on those tasks by staff. This can be useful in professional services
          organizations as a truer representation of work-levels being
          allocated to tasks, and thus in helping improve utilisation and this
          client-billing. It does obviously mean that managers need to keep
          regular tabs on staff activity, such that even if staff don't
          nominate work effort on a task (via a time sheet entry), then a
          manager can make a note to query the staff member about that effort.

.. NOTE:: In order to make use of this facility, you need to have Manager
          privileges and you also need to switch on the New Time Sheet Item
          Hint option for your Home page. The New Time Sheet Item Hint feature
          provides a text-entry box on the user's Home page. This will allow
          them to quickly add indications (or hints) of what work different
          team members are doing. To learn how to enable this feature, please
          refer to `How do I Customise my Home Page?`_ .

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Click into the Home page.

#.  In the information block titled New Time Sheet Item Hint, enter the
    following items within the textbox:

    #.  Username - of the person whom you're adding this time sheet hint
        for.
    #.  Duration - in the standard time increments for that user (e.g.,
        hours).
    #.  Task ID - the ID of the task that you want to add this hint for.
    #.  Comment - an optional note for your future reference.

    .. NOTE:: As you're typing these details into the textbox, allocPSA will
              being rendering them into a time-sheet hint entry, in the lower
              part of the information block, showing you the details in a
              fuller-form.

#.  Once you're satisfied that the information you've entered and had
    presented back to you is correct, press the Enter key. This will cause
    allocPSA to accept the material you've provided, and add it as a hint
    in the corresponding task.

.. NOTE:: This tool is useful in hinting at (and perhaps capturing) 'time
          effort' which is performed by staff, if the staff aren't transacting
          any activities through allocPSA for that task. If, however, the staff
          are taking actions on the task which allocPSA is capturing, then you
          can use another tool to capture any missing time-sheet entries, the
          Effort Exception Report. To learn how to enable this feature, please
          refer to `How do I Prepare an Un-billed Effort Exception Report?`_ .

How do I Find My Currently Active Timesheets?
---------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Click into the Home page.

#.  Look in the Current Time Sheets information block. Any time-sheets
    which you can edit are marked as Add Time in Status. Any other
    time-sheets are either with a Manager or with Admin.

#.  To open a time-sheet, click on its corresponding Project link.



How do I Make My Time-sheet Editable Again?
-------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: Once a time-sheet has been submitted by a user, then that user can no
          longer edit it. To make it editable again, the user needs to ask the
          appropriate person (time-sheet or project manager, Admin) to send the
          time-sheet back.

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Click into the Home page.

#.  Look in the Current Time Sheets information block. Any time-sheets
    which you can edit are marked as Add Time in Status. Any other
    time-sheets are either with a Manager or with Admin.

#.  To open a time-sheet, click on its corresponding Project link.

#.  Once opened, you can use the Comments section of the time-sheet to
    send the appropriate people (time-sheet or project manager, Admin) a
    message, asking for the time-sheet to be sent back. This will then
    re-open the time-sheet for editing by the user.

.. NOTE:: Some time-sheets have both a Manager who approves the time-sheet, and
          Admin, who processes it as part of the workflow. If a time-sheet is
          vested with the Admin user(s), then they first need to send the
          time-sheet back to the authorising manager, who then sends the
          time-sheet back to the user/staff-member. To learn how to send
          time-sheets back along the workflow chain, please refer to `How do I
          Reject a Time Sheet?`_ .

How do I Authorise a Time Sheet?
--------------------------------

.. NOTE:: You must be setup as a Project Manager + Time Sheet Recipient (on the
          Project screen) or be setup as the Time Sheet Admin on the Setup
          screen in order to authorise Time Sheets.

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Click 'admin' or 'manager' on 'Time Sheets Pending Your Approval' table
    which is located on the lower right side of the 'Home' page

#.  If you're happy with the information contained on the Time Sheet, press the
    button to submit the Time Sheet to the next step in the workflow.

Alternatively, if an organization wants a default Time sheet manager,
this is possible to configure via the Time Sheets tab in the Setup
section. Simply edit the Time Sheet Manager to point to the person who
should be the default.

How do I Reject a Time Sheet?
-----------------------------

.. NOTE:: If you've received a message that a specific time-sheet needs to be
          rejected (or perhaps even sent back to the previous person on the
          time-sheet workflow chain), you can simply find that time-sheet using
          allocPSA's standard Search tool. For more information on how to jump
          to a time-sheet quickly, please refer to `How do I Quickly Jump to a
          Time Sheet if I have the Time Sheet ID?`_ . Once you've found the
          time-sheet, you can continue with the appropriate steps in this
          routine, below.

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  In the Time Sheets Pending Manager information block, you may see a
    list of time-sheets which need your approval.

    .. NOTE:: If you are the Admin user, who processes time-sheets, this broad
              process works also works for you, modulo using the time-sheets
              indicated in the Time Sheets Pending Admin information block.

#.  To open each time-sheet in turn, click the Date link associated with
    that time-sheet.

#.  If you perceive that there is a problem with the time-sheet, then add a
    New Comment specifying what the originator should do to fix then re-submit
    the time-sheet, ensuring that you add the appropriate user (and yourself) to
    that comment thread.

#.  Once the new comment has been entered, click the Save Comment button.

#.  To actually send the time-sheet back, then press the '<- Back' button on the
    Time Sheet (not the web-browser's Back button). Note that this will
    send the time-sheet back to the previous person in the time-sheet
    workflow chain, which may be the time-sheet manager, if you're the
    Admin user. If so, you should be able to click the '<- Back' button
    again, to ensure that the time-sheet reaches the actual original user
    who submitted the time-sheet.

#.  An email will be sent to the previous person in the Time Sheet
    workflow, and they can then process the time-sheet accordingly.


How do I Send a Copy of a Time Sheet to Others?
-----------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  From either the Time Sheet section of your 'Home' page, or from the
    timesheets visible in the Time tab, select a time sheet that you want
    to send a copy of to someone.

#.  From inside the time sheet, click the New Comment near the bottom right.
    This will expand the Comments functionality.

#.  Using either a boiler-plate comment template, or by adding your own
    text, provide a message in the Comment text box.

#.  Click the Attach Time Sheet drop-list and select from the options the
    appropriate content and document format for the time sheet you wish to
    send. Unless you know otherwise, you can just select the Default
    option.

#.  From the Email Recipients section, select the people who you want to
    send a copy of this comment and attached time sheet to.

#.  If you want to add a recipient who doesn't appear on the prepared list of
    recipients, you can add them by click-expanding the Email Other Party link,
    adding their details, and deciding about having them added permanently.


How do I Find Client Information?
---------------------------------

#.  Log into allocPSA.

#.  From the toolbar, select the 'Clients' tab.

#.  Click 'Show Filter'.

#.  Choose the status of the Client you want to find, by default 'Current' is
    set.

#.  You now have three options. You can select the first letter of the Client
    organization's name and be shown a list of Clients starting with that name.

#.  Alternatively, you can type the Client organization's name in the 'Client
    Name' text box, then press the 'Filter' button.

#.  Or, you and enter the contact name.

#.  You can also filter the list of clients by category.

#.  A list of Clients matching the criteria is shown.

.. HINT:: You can also use your browser's Find facility, to locate any known
          part of the text of Client's information.

.. HINT:: If the Client's name begins with a number or other, non-alphabetical
          character, then they will be listed under the 'A' filter list.

.. HINT:: If you're looking at the list of Clients, you can send email to their
          primary contact, assuming that one exists and they have an email
          address listed in allocPSA, by clicking on their email address as
          shown in the 'Clients' listing page.

.. HINT:: If you're presently in any particular Client's page, you can send
          email to any of the contacts by clicking on their email address (once
          again, assuming they have one) as shown in the Client contact page.

How do I Add Client Information?
--------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  From the action 'Quick List' drop list on the allocPSA toolbar, select 'New
    Client'.

#.  You will be presented with the Client record information header. This
    contains the information which pertains to that Client organization, such as
    central phone and fax numbers, physical and mail addresses etc.

#.  Fill in the details of the Client.

#.  Press the 'Save' button.

#.  You are now able to attach as many Contacts to this Client record
    information header as you want.

#.  To do so, fill in the first 'Add New Contact' sub-form.

#.  Press the 'Save Client Contact' button.

#.  If you have added more than one Contact person, and want to make one of them
    to the primary contact person, edit the contact and use the 'Primary
    Contact' checkbox associated with that Contact.

#.  If you want to add any Client-level comments, you can do so via the
    'Comment' tab.

#.  Furthermore, if you want to add a document (such as a contract, agreement,
    photo, database etc.) related to the Client, go to the 'Attachments' tab
    and upload attachments.


How do I Find Map References for a Client Address?
--------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click into the 'Clients' tab and locate the client you want to add a map
    reference for. Alternatively, use the Quick Search facility to locate
    a specific client.

#.  On the 'Clients' page, click the 'View map' link, under the address field.

How do I Archive Old Client Contacts?
-------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on the 'Clients' tab and locate the client you're interested in.
    Alternatively, use the Quick Search facility to locate a specific client.

#.  Within the 'Clients' page, locate the specific contact that you want to
    archive from the Client Contacts section.

#.  Click the Edit button for that contact.

#.  Uncheck the 'Enabled' checkbox.

#.  Click the 'Save Client Contact' button, to save your changes.

.. NOTE:: This action will cause the specific contact details to be still
          available and visible, but it moves this information to the bottom of
          the Client page, and greys it out.


How do I Check the Modification History for Tasks, Projects?
------------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on the 'Tasks' or 'Projects' tab and locate the task or project
    you're interested in. Alternatively, use the Quick Search facility to
    locate that task or project.

#.  Once you-re on the task or project page, click on the History tab to view
    the history.

#.  This will display any information regarding changes to the 'header'
    of this record, such as changes in key settings, when they were made,
    and who made these changes.


How do I Quickly Jump to a Task if I have the Task ID?
------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  If you have a valid task ID (e.g., '12762') then you can enter this
    directly into the Quick Search textbox near the top right of the
    allocPSA screen.

#.  Entering a number here indicates to allocPSA that you know it is a
    Task ID number and that you want to be taken straight to that task.

#.  This same approach works for some other search items available
    under the Quick Search facility; given a Project or Timesheet ID, you
    can quickly jump to those by selecting the appropriate entity from
    the droplist associated with Quick Search.


How do I Quickly Jump to a Time Sheet if I have the Time Sheet ID?
------------------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  If you have a valid time sheet ID (e.g., '12762') then you can enter this
    directly into the Quick Search textbox near the top right of the
    allocPSA screen.

#.  Entering a number here indicates to allocPSA that you know it is a time
    sheet ID number and that you want to be taken straight to that task.

#.  This same approach works for some other search items available
    under the Quick Search facility; given a Project or Task ID, you can
    quickly jump to those by selecting the appropriate entity from
    the droplist associated with Quick Search.


How do I Add Task/Fault Comments?
---------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the Task/Fault you want to add a comment to.

#.  Click on the Comments tab.

#.  Click 'New Comment'.

#.  Write your comment, and then choose the recipients.

#.  If you want to add a recipient who doesn't appear on the prepared list of
    recipients, you can add them by click-expanding the Email Other Party link,
    adding their details, and deciding about having them added permanently.

#.  If you want to add an attachment to this Comment, click the Attach File
    link to expand it, then browse to the file you want to attach and click the
    Choose button. You can repeat this process to attach more files/documents.
    Any files you attach will be sent along with the email to all the
    recipients listed with checkboxes, and will also be attached to this
    comment in this Task, for future reference.

#.  If your server is set up to receive email and you have configured allocPSA
    correctly you should be able to send emails to and from clients, using only
    your regular email client, all the while having the emails going through
    the alloc gateway and being logged to the relevant task or fault.


How do I Continue with a Task Comment Conversation Thread?
----------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: In order to continue with an existing task comment
          discussion/conversation thread, you will have needed to be on that
          thread in the first place.

#.  Open your email client.

#.  You will notice that allocPSA emails have a particular structure in the
    subject line, perhaps something like:

    Task Comment: 16713 Investigate Anti-Virus options for Staff server [3. Normal] {Key:cijhkjuq}

#.  Assuming you know the Task ID for the comment you want to respond to,
    thus continuing the discussion thread, find an email which relates to
    that task.

#.  Use your email client's standard 'Reply to' button to reply to that task.

        .. NOTE:: you do not need to do a Reply-all or Group-reply, as replying
                  through the allocPSA email gateway will ensure that all the
                  people on that conversation thread will be automatically sent
                  a copy of your response.

#.  If you want to reply to a specific conversation thread, as
    represented by a Key, for example {Key:cijhkjuq} from above, use that
    key as your search criterion in your email client, rather than just the
    Task ID.

How do I Establish a Default Interested Parties List for a Project's Tasks?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: allocPSA has a concept of Interested Parties; namely, people both
          within and external to your organization who may be involved in work
          and responses on tasks. For each task you create, you can nominate
          who should be added to any conversation threads that originate on
          that task, by default. Obviously, this list can be hand-tweaked for
          not only each task, but also for each separate new discussion thread
          on that task. For more information on Interested Parties and
          discussion threads, please refer to `How do I Add Task/Fault
          Comments?`_ .

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  If you're creating a new project and want to add a default Interested
    Parties list for it, please refer to `How do I Create a New
    Project?`_ first, then continue here.

#.  If you already have an existing project, open it.

#.  Once you're on the project's main page, click the Edit Project
    button. This will open the project's header for editing.

#.  The Default Interested Parties drop-list should show you the various
    people, internal and external, associated with this project. If you
    click the drop-list, it will reveal the list, from which you can
    click-toggle the people you want as members of any task's default
    Interested Parties.

#.  Once you've established who should be on each new project task's
    Interested Parties list, you can click the 'Save' button.

How do I Establish Default Rates for People?
--------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: This function assumes that your organization sets default rates for
          some or all staff.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click into the People tab.

#.  From the list present, open the page for the staff member you want to
    set a default rate for.

#.  In the Default Rate field, enter the rate and then select the
    duration (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) from the drop-list.

#.  Click the 'Save' button.

.. NOTE:: When you next add this person to a project, their rate and duration
          will be entered automatically.


How do I Bookmark Task List Filters for Future Use?
---------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on the Tasks tab to bring up the Task List.

#.  Change the filter settings to reflect what you want to show in the
    list. You can select which projects you want to show the tasks for,
    which project resources; open or closed tasks; which fields you want
    displayed, etc.

#.  When done, apply the Filter.

#.  You will be shown the resulting filtered Task List.

#.  If you want to view the updated list with the same filters applied in
    future. You can now Bookmark this page, using your web-browsers standard
    bookmarking functionality.

#.  To bring up the Filter in the future, merely access the stored Bookmark,
    and allocPSA will provide a refreshed view of the same Task List filter.


How do I Mark a Task as Pending?
--------------------------------

.. NOTE:: Under some circumstances, there may be value in marking some tasks in
          such a way that they don't appear in the normal, day-to-day views,
          but are still available just on the periphery. This might occur when
          where you're waiting on information, or waiting on customer approval
          or feedback. allocPSA provides a convenient way to manage such
          'paused' tasks, through the Pending attribute.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as
    Pending.

#.  From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
    will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
    Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.

#.  Select the Pending option from the Status droplist. For example,
    Pending: Info, which means that the task is in limbo while specific
    information is sought, or Pending: Manager, which means that the task
    awaiting the go-ahead from an allocPSA manager, or Pending: Client,
    which means that the task is awaiting information or the go-ahead
    from the Client associated with the task.

#.  Once the Pending option has been selected, Save the task.

#.  You can, at any point, change the Status back to Open: or any other
    setting using the approach outlined above.

.. NOTE:: You will note that a task which has had its Status changed from Open:
          to Pending: may now not be included in the Task List filter or the
          Home Page filter, if these have been established to show only Open:
          tasks.

.. NOTE:: If a user selects to show only Open and not Open and Pending tasks in
          their allocPSA 'home' page, then tasks marked Pending will not appear
          in the 'home' page task list.


How do I Close a Task?
----------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as
    Closed.

#.  From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
    will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
    Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.

#.  Select one of the Closed options from the Status droplist. For example,
    Closed: Invalid, which means that the task was incorrectly added to
    allocPSA, or Closed: Duplicate, which means that the task is a
    duplicate of another, existing task, or Closed: Incomplete, which means
    that the task could not be completed, or the issue resolved, or
    Closed: Completed, which means that task was completed or the
    fault/issue resolved.

#.  Once the Closed option has been selected, Save the task.

#.  You can, at any point, change the Status back to Open: or any other
    setting using the approach outlined above.

.. NOTE:: You will note that if you mark the task Closed: Duplicate, then you
          will be prompted for the Task ID of the task which it's a duplicate
          of, for record-keeping purposes. This is covered in detail elsewhere
          in this documentation. allocPSA allows for one and only one
          'duplicate' task to be linked to.

.. NOTE:: You will also note that once you close a task, the Actual Completion
          date will be set to today's date.


How do I Make (Attribute) Changes to Many Tasks at Once?
--------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: While you are able to make changes to attributes (e.g., Task
          Assignee, Task Priority, Completion Date etc.) on a per-task basis,
          allocPSA offers you a mechanism by which you can change these
          properties across many tasks at once.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the Tasks tab, and list the tasks you are interested in making
    changes to. This may be a super-set of the actual tasks you want to
    change, for example, all Open tasks, or all tasks assigned to a
    particular person for a select group of projects.

#.  Using the 'checkboxes' running along the left edge of the task list,
    select the tasks you're interested in changing an attribute for.

#.  Once you've selected all the pertinent tasks, select the *type* of
    attribute change action you want to make. Examples include:

    - Assign to:
    - Manager to:
    - Time Limit to:
    - Task Priority to:
    - Task Type to:
    - Target Start Date to:
    - Target Completion Date to:
    - Actual Start Date to:
    - Actual Completion Date to:
    - Project and Parent Task to:

#.  For each of these attribute change actions, you will be given a
    custom data entry field or pick list, from which you can select the
    new attribute value to set for your list of selected tasks.

#.  Once you've set the new attribute value for the group, click the
    Update Tasks button, to make the actual change across your list of
    selected tasks.

#.  If you have more than one attribute change to make across this list of
    tasks, follow the above steps, and change additional attributes.


How do I Mark a Task as a Duplicate?
------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as a duplicate.

#.  From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
    will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
    Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.

#.  Select the Closed: Duplicate option from the Status droplist.

#.  This will show a textbox beside the Status droplist, into which you should
    enter the Task ID of the task which it's a duplicate of, for record-keeping
    purposes. allocPSA allows for one and only one 'duplicate' task to be linked
    to.

#.  Save the task.


How do I use the allocPSA Email Gateway?
----------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Ensure allocPSA and your webserver is configured to send and receive emails.
    (Setup -> Email screen)

#.  Create a task, or open an existing task.

#.  Create a comment and select which recipients you would like to receive your
    comment.

#.  Hit the Save Comment button.

    .. NOTE:: that if you want to receive the replies to that comment you will
              need to select your own name from the list of recipients.

#.  You can also use certain keywords in your reply to access additional
    functionality via email.

    The allocPSA task email subject lines currently look something like this:

    [allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd}

    When composing an email reply via your regular email client, you may
    append certain keywords *after* the {Key:fdsfds} bit. The keywords are not
    case-sensitive and can be in any order. You can use one-or-many of:

    * sub subscribe
    * unsub unsubscribe
    * close pending open
    * notstarted inprogress info manager client invalid duplicate:1234 incomplete complete
    * quiet
    * 3.25 (i.e. a number, to two decimal places)

    Sub/Subscribe adds you to that alloc task conversation. Unsub/unsubscribe
    removes you from that conversation. Some text will be prepended to the
    comment saying what has happened e.g.: "Jonny Apple has been added to this
    conversation".

    Close closes the associated task. Open opens the task. And Pending makes the
    task status pending. The Actual Completion date is filled or unfilled and the
    Task Status moves to Closed:Completed or Open:In progress or Pending:Info.
    The action is logged on the Task History tab.

    If you want to exert finer control over the Task Status, you may use one of
    the specific Task Sub-Status keywords: notstarted, inprogress, info,
    manager, client, invalid, duplicate, incomplete or complete. If the task is
    to be a duplicate, specify the duplicate task ID after a colon e.g.:
    duplicate:1234

    Quiet means do not re-send this email. Previously only unsubscribe requests
    would *not* get re-sent. Now they *do* get re-emailed. You can quell them
    with this "quiet" keyword. Likewise, if you just want to add a comment to
    the conversation thread without re-emailing everyone, quiet is what you
    want.

    A number. This number represents a time duration for a time sheet. This way
    you can add time to a time sheet via email. If no time sheet exists, one is
    automatically created. If you are not on the project, the time sheet is
    still created and the time sheet item entry is still added, however your
    rate will be set to zero, and you will have to fix it manually.
    Additionally some text will be prepended to the top of the comment which
    says e.g. "Danielle Johnston has added 2.00 Hours to time sheet #34232."
    and/or "Danielle Johnston has not been added to project #22".  The body of
    the email is added as the time sheet item comment. So it is best to keep
    the email short. It probably makes sense to add the quiet keyword when
    adding time.

    So if you reply to alloc with an email that has a subject line like this:

    [allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd} 3.25 quiet close

    then:

    * 3.25 (hours/days/or whatever is specified at the project level) are added
      to your time sheet.
    * No email is re-sent to people.
    * The task is closed.

    or e.g. this:

    [allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd} open unsub 10

    then:

    * Task is re-opened (if it was closed).
    * You are removed from that task conversation.
    * 10 hours/days/etc are added to your time sheet for that task.

    The system uses your From address to identify you. If you don't use a from
    address that is recognized by alloc then your commands are mostly ignored.
    However, if the {Key:} is correct the comment will still be added. So for
    example if a client sticks random numbers in the subject line, it's not
    going to randomly create time sheets, but the comment will still come
    across.

    Everything up to the {Key:sfdsffs} is actually ignored, so the email could
    just look like this:

    To: alloc@somewhere.com.au
    From: ben@otherplace.com.au
    Subject: {Key:fds432fd} close 3

    All emails that alloc receives are stored and are available for download
    (if need be) from the UI same as usual, headers intact. Ideally you are
    also storing your sent-mail which should make reconciliation a little
    easier. alloc also stores a new field on the back-end that tracks which
    emails are responsible for which time sheet items.

How do I Monitor Tagged-Funds/Cost-Centres That I'm Interested In?
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: allocPSA supports cost-centres (also-known-as tagged-funds) for
          projects and staff. These allow for the tracking and movement of
          monies within an organization and amongst an organization's project
          and staff 'boundaries'. Tagged-funds are used to determine and track
          expenses, time sheets, etc. Some people, particularly Admin and
          Manager users, may need to track many such tagged-funds at once. As
          such, they may find it useful to have those particular tagged-funds
          display their current account balance on the 'home' page. To make
          this happen, follow these steps.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the Tools tab of the main menu.

#.  From the Finance list, click the List of Tagged Funds link. The
    Tagged Funds list will appear, but it may take awhile, as allocPSA
    has to perform quite a few calculations.

#.  If the list is too long, you can expand the Filter to allow you to
    drill-down into the tagged funds you're interested in. To do so,
    click the Show Filter link, near the top right.

#.  When you find the tagged fund that you want to add an account-balance
    view of in your 'home' page, click the Edit TF link, at the right of
    the selected tagged fund.

#.  Once inside the tagged fund, you will notice that it offers you a
    drop-list to your name as one of the tagged fund owners, in the
    TF owners section of the page. Once you've selected your name from
    the list, click the Add button.

#.  You can now check that this additional tagged-fund/cost-centre is
    visible to you from your 'home' page, by clicking on the Home tab of
    the main menu, and checking that the new tagged fund account balance
    is being displayed in the Tagged Funds content block near the top
    right.


How do I Quickly Jump Back to a Recent Task/Project/Timesheet Page?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

More often than not, you'll need to quickly jump back to a recently
opened/created/modified data entity (task, project, timesheet, etc).
allocPSA allows a speedy way to achieve this action.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open a task, timesheet, project or other mainstream data entity page.

#.  For the purposes of demonstration, you don't need to make any changes
    to this data entity, but you can if you want to.

#.  Now, open another task, timesheet, project or other mainstream data
    entity page.

#.  You can do this a few more times, building up a small list of
    recently visited data entities.

#.  You can now jump quickly back to each of these, by selected them from
    the QuickList drop-list, near the top-right of the allocPSA screen.
    The list of recently-visited data entities will appear just below the
    group of New <Entity> options, shown at the top of the list.


How do I Customise my Home Page?
--------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on your name on the right side of the page near 'Help' and 'Login'.
    This will open up your personal settings page, called 'Person Details'.

#.  On the right of the 'Person Details' page, you will see the Preferences
    section.

#.  Change the settings for Font size, Theme, Top Tasks etc.

    - Font size will alter the default font allocPSA uses

    - Theme will alter the colours (look and feel) of allocPSA

    - Daily Email: Control whether you receive a daily task email.

    - Self Mail: Whether you receive a copy of you own comment in an
      email.

    - Homepage Projects: displays project list box on the home page.

    - Show Filters: Control whether the filters are displayed by default
      on the various tabs in alloc.

    - Homepage Tasks: Display the task list box on the home page.

    - Homepage Calendar: Display the calendar box on the home page.

    - Homepage Time Sheet Stats: Display the time sheet stats box on the home
      page.

    - Homepage New Time Sheet Item: Display the add new time sheet item box on
      the home page.

    - Homepage Private Mode: Prevent someone who is standing over your shoulder
      from seeing financial amounts on the homepage.

    - Homepage New Time Sheet Item Hint: Display the add new time sheet item
      hint box on the home page.

#.  Once you've made the changes you need to make, click the 'Save' button.


How do I Customise my Home Page Information Blocks?
---------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the Home page tab.

    .. NOTE:: Most of the information content blocks (for example Tasks, Project
              List, New Time Sheet Item, etc.) have display configuration options.

#.  Click the spanner icon next to the block you wish to adjust.

    .. NOTE:: For more information on what the various content block options are,
              please refer to `How do I Customise my Home Page?`_ .

#.  Once you've made the changes you need to make, click the 'Save' button that
    relates to this Preferences section. (For the tasks block click 'Filter')
    If you've made changes you don't want to keep, click Cancel.


How do I Hide any Sensitive Financial Data in my Home Page?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of pages in allocPSA which display financial data. Most of
these relate to work arranged by managers or admin staff, and are accessed
infrequently or under specific circumstances. There is also potentially
sensitive financial data on each user's Home page. allocPSA therefore provides
a method to obfuscate this sensitive data, if the user deems that necessary. To
instantiate this obfuscation, the user needs to:

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on your name on the right side of the page near 'Help' and 'Login'.
    This will open up your personal settings page, called 'Person Details'.

#.  On the right of the Person Details page, you will see the Preferences
    section.

#.  Switch on the private mode by selecting Yes in the 'Homepage Private Mode'
    drop-list. This ensures that any sensitive (i.e., financial) information
    which is normally visible on the user's Home page, is now obfuscated, made
    visible only by moving the mouse over those fields.

#.  Once you've made the changes you need to make, click the Save button
    that relates to this Preferences section.


How do I Sort Tables of Data?
-----------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the table of data you would like to sort.

#.  Click on the heading text of the column that you would like to sort by.


How do I Star Clients, Tasks, Projects, etc.?
---------------------------------------------

allocPSA gives you the ability to add specific records (such as Tasks, Clients,
Projects, Timesheets, Sales, and Invoices) to the Star list. These can then be
accessed in a collective 'star' page, by clicking the 'star' icon, located in the
top right section of the main menu, near the Help, Setup and Logout links.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the specific data item that is of interest, for example a Task,
    or a Client record.

#.  If on a specific record, for example a single Task, you will notice a small
    'star' icon, near the top right of that item's menu. Click on that small 'star'
    icon.  This will fill the icon with a solid colour, which indicates that
    this record is now in your 'star' list of bookmarks. If you click that
    filled-in 'star' icon once more, it will toggle-off the bookmark.

    .. HINT:: If you're looking a list of Tasks for instance, you will see a
              list of 'star' icons along the right edge of the table. Clicking on
              any of these will toggle the 'stars' on (filled star) or off (empty
              star), corresponding to that item being in or out of your Star list.

#.  To view your 'star' list of bookmarks, click on the main 'filled in' star
    icon, near the top right of your main screen's menu items.

#.  This will open the 'star' list, showing you all your various bookmarks for
    the different types of items that you've stared.

#.  To remove an item from your Star bookmark list, click (that is,
    uncheck) the 'filled in' star associated with that item (on the far
    right of that item's entry in the table). This will toggle-off the
    bookmark. If you refresh the page, or click on the Star list icon (near
    the top right of your main screen's menu items) again, the item you
    had unchecked should no longer be present.


How do I Specify Annual Leave or Absence?
-----------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA

#.  Click on your name on the right side of the page near 'Help' and 'Login'.

#.  At the bottom of the page, you will find a link called 'New Absence'. Click
    this.

#.  On the Absence Form which appears, nominate the Date From and the Date To
    for your leave of absence.

#.  Select the type of Leave (Annual Leave, Holiday, etc.)

#.  Add any new/additional emergency contact details or pertinent information
    that your colleagues may find valuable.

#.  Click the Save button.


How do I Check that I've Billed Completely on a Task?
-----------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the task you're interested in checking.

#.  Click onto the Comments tab.

#.  Click the Summary link on the top-right side of the task. This will switch
    the comments into summary mode, sorted on date.

#.  Review the summary items, checking to see if you've done work on the task.
    The time-sheet entries are marked in **Bold**.

#.  If you find that there is un-billed work, then you can Click back into the
    Main task tab, and then click the Time Sheet link near the top-right side of
    this page. Now you can add an appropriately dated time-sheet item to an
    existing time-sheet, or create a new time-sheet and do the same.

.. NOTE:: You can 'expand' any of these task comments by clicking on them. This
          will help you establish the context of the actions taken, and to help
          determine if this is indeed work that needed to be billed.


How do I Sort Task Comments by Date Order?
------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the task you're interested in.

#.  Click onto the Comments tab.

#.  Click the Summary link on the top-right side of the task. This will switch
    the comments into summary mode, sorted on date.

#.  You can 'expand' any of these task comments by clicking on them.

#.  To get back to the normal, full threaded view of the task comments, click
    the Full link, on the top-right side of the task.


How do I Prepare an Un-billed Effort Exception Report?
------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on the Tools tab.

#.  Click on the Task Comment Summary link. This will bring up the Task Comment
    Summary page.

#.  Click on the Show Filter link, near the top-right of this page, which will
    present you with the filter tool.

#.  Select/de-select the projects you're interested in preparing an un-billed
    effort exception report on.

#.  Select the time-sheeting person/people you're interested in including in
    this report.

#.  Select the Start Date for this report.

#.  Select the End Date for this report.

#.  Select the Task Status, for the types of task you want to check the
    un-billed effort on. It's often best to leave this 'blank'.

#.  For a full-overview of the actions taken and their context, you can also
    check the 'Include Client Comments' check-box, but this isn't often needed.

#.  Click the Filter button. You will now be presented with a list of tasks,
    which that person (or people) took actions on, along with any corresponding
    time-sheet entries. This list is grouped per-task, sorted on date.

#.  You can 'expand' any of these task comments by clicking on them. This will
    help you establish the context of the actions taken, and to help determine if
    this is indeed work that needed to be billed.

#.  Review the summary items, checking to see if you've done work on this task,
    for which there isn't a corresponding time-sheet entry.  The time-sheet
    entries are marked in **Bold**. A good rule-of-thumb is, if you see task
    comment entries, with no **bold** time-sheet line beneath them, this is
    possibly an item of work which hasn't been time-sheeted.

#.  If you determine that a user has under billed for work performed, you can
    right-mouse button click on the related task link, or otherwise cause it to
    be opened in a new browser tab, go to the Comments tab, and add a new
    entry, including appropriate internal/external parties (specifically the
    user who under billed) and alert them to this possibility.

#.  They can then review this, and remedy the situation by submitting a new
    time-sheet entry for this under (or non-) billed work.


How do I Print a Task Ticket so I can take it with me on a Job?
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: Assuming you want the total volume of information related to this
          task, it's history, the client it relates to, their address etc.,
          allocPSA offers a mechanism to prepare a printer-friendly version of
          this information.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Open the task you're interested in.

#.  Click on the Print link, which is situated just to the side of the main
    screen tabs, along the top of the allocPSA page.

#.  This will bring up a full-detail, printer-friendly version of the
    information relating to this task, including the address and contact
    details of the client, which you can then print off your browser, and take
    with you on an on-site visit.

#.  To get back to your normal allocPSA page, just use your browser's Back
    button.


How do I Print a Printer-Friendly Version of the Task List?
-----------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on the Tasks tab.

#.  Use the filter tool to prepare a list of the tasks you're interested in.

#.  Click on the 'PDF' link.

#.  This will produce a more printer-friendly version of the list shown
    on-screen.

#.  Click on your browser's Print toolbar or select Print from your browser's
    File menu.

#.  To get back to your normal allocPSA page, just use your browser's Back
    button.


How do I Check to Ensure Users are Submitting Their Time-sheets in a Timely Manner?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: This process assumes that your organization has a policy which
          outlines that time-sheets should be submitted to time-sheet managers,
          in a timely manner. One example would be that time-sheets should be
          no older than 7 days.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click on to the Time tab.

#.  Click the Show Filter link, to reveal the filter tool.

#.  If you want to check a particular user's time-sheet, select that user,
    otherwise leave the User Name drop-list blank.

#.  Supply the Start Date From field. This sets the 'lower-bound' of what
    time-sheet item dates to include in the filter.

#.  Supply the Start Date To field. This sets the 'upper-bound' of what
    time-sheet item dates to include in the filter.

#.  In the Status drop-list, select Add Time, as this will show you the
    time-sheets that users have created, but not yet submitted to management.

#.  If you want to check time-sheets lodged with a particular project, select
    that project from the Project drop-list, otherwise leave it blank.

#.  Click the Filter button. This will generate a (possibly lengthy) list of
    time-sheets, assigned to projects, users etc.

#.  Sort the list by Start Date, by clicking on the START DATE column header.
    This will show you the time-sheet with the oldest time-sheet item at the
    top of the table.

#.  Check that this date is no further in the past than your organizations
    time-sheet submission policy allows for.

#.  If it is, and **if** you want to notify your user of this possible
    infraction, right-click on the record link (in the Project) column, and
    cause that time-sheet to be brought up on a new browser tab.

#.  In that new tab, review the time-sheet, confirm that it's now overdue, then
    go to the button of the time-sheet, where you'll find the Comments section.

#.  Click the New link at the lower-right side of the time-sheet page. This
    will open up a modified form of the comments tool found in tasks.

#.  Select the time-sheet creator/user, and any other interested parties
    (time-sheet managers, admin, etc.) from the list of Email Recipients.

#.  Using either a pre-scripted response (i.e., from the Comment Template
    drop-list) or entering your own message, send out a note saying that this
    time-sheet is old and should be submitted.

#.  When complete, click the Save Comment button. This email will now be sent
    to these email recipients.

#.  Return to the previous tab, the one that listed the filtered time-sheets,
    (i.e., step 10. above) and work your way down the list.

.. _How_do_I_Email_a_Time-Sheet_to_Customers:


How do I Email a Time-Sheet to Customers?
-----------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the time-sheet that you want to send out.

#.  Go to the bottom of the time-sheet, where you'll find the Comments section.

#.  Click the New link at the lower-right side of the time-sheet page. This
    will open up a modified form of the comments tool found in tasks.

#.  Select the appropriate interested parties (customer contact(s), time-sheet
    manager, admin, etc.) from the list of Email Recipients.

#.  Using either a pre-scripted response (i.e., from the Comment Template
    drop-list) or entering your own message, add text to the comment text box,
    letting everyone know the purpose of this message.

#.  From the Attach Time Sheet drop-list, select one of the options. Unless you
    have reason to specify otherwise, select Default. This will cause a copy of
    the time-sheet to be attached to the outgoing email, as a PDF.

#.  When complete, click the Save Comment button. This email will now be sent
    to the email recipients.


How do I Manage Support and Help Desk Tasks
-------------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: Some help-desk systems call support tasks 'tickets'. In this
          documentation, tickets and tasks can be used inter-changeably.  While
          there are no functional differences between tasks assigned in
          'help-desk' type projects or tasks assigned to more traditional 'life-cycle'
          projects, these are sometimes managed differently, or by different
          people within an organization.  Help-desk tasks/tickets are generally
          created and managed on an ad-hoc and on-going basis, and help-desk
          tasks are oft-times managed by more than one person within an
          organization. The nature of the processes used to manage such tasks
          is therefore related to these attributes.

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  As a help-desk manager, you are likely to want to manage all, or some
    portion of the currently active open support tickets. You can best do this by
    going to the Task tab.

#.  Within the Task list page, click on the Show Filter link, along the
    top-right of the page.

#.  Within this filter, click the Projects link, situated just above the list of
    projects. This will expand the different categories of Projects.

#.  From this list, click the Current option. This will then show you all the
    current, active, open projects.

#.  To display all the relevant tasks, either select *all* of the projects
    listed, or de-select them all, so that none are high-lighted in the list.

#.  To see the currently active tasks, select Open from the Task Status drop-list.

#.  To view the fault tasks/tickets, select Fault from the Task Type list.

#.  If you want to further filter down into particular task attributes, you can
    choose these from the Created By, Managed By and Assigned To drop-lists. If you
    don't have requirements for further filtering, leave these blank.

#.  You can now select to see a variety of fields on the list of tasks to be
    filtered. For instance, if you want to see all the details of each task,
    you can check the Description & Comments. The following gives you more
    information about each of these options:

    - Description & Comments: This will show you the description of each task
      listed, along with all the comments.

    .. NOTE:: Use this option carefully, as the volume of data may be
              substantial. In general, unless you know there are only a few tasks
              in the returned task list, don't check this checkbox.

    - Task Dates: This gives you additional information on each task's Target
      Start, Target Completion,  Actual Start, Actual Completion and Task Created
      dates.

    - Task Creator: This will display the name of the user who created each task

    - Task Manager: This will display the name of the user who is set up on the
      task as the task manager.

    - Est, Act & Percent: This will display information on the task's time
      Estimate, the Actual time time-sheeted thus far, and the overall percentage
      of the time time-sheeted versus the estimate. *If* the amount of time
      time-sheeted for this task is more than the time estimated, then the
      percentage will be displayed in **red**.

    - Assigned To:  This will display the name of the user who this task is assigned to.

    - Priority Info: This will display each task's Project and Task priority, along
      with an overall computed Priority, based on the age of the task, attributed
      priorities, etc.

    - Date Status: This will display a computed date estimate to complete the task,
      based on effort and time spent thus far. A typical output would be something
      like 'Started 2010-06-30, forecast completion date of 2010-12-06'.

#.  You can also select to filter based on Task Date attributes, by selecting
    items from the Task Date droplist. Options include:

    - New Tasks,

    - Due Today,

    - Overdue,

    - Date Created (and then supply a data range on which to filter),

    - Date Assigned (and then supply a data range on which to filter),

    - Estimated Start (and then supply a data range on which to filter),

    - Estimated Completion (and then supply a data range on which to filter),

    - Date Started (and then supply a data range on which to filter),

    - Date Completed (and then supply a data range on which to filter).

#.  Once all the filter options have been selected, click the Filter button.
    This will generate the list of tasks which match your filter criteria and
    display the information on those tasks, based on your output options.

#.  The resulting table can be sorted on particular columns, for instance, task
    ID or task Priority, in the usual manner, by clicking on the column header.
    Click twice to reverse the sort order.

#.  You can 'drill-down' into specific tasks, by clicking on their
    corresponding task name.

#.  Using this Tasks page, you can filter and sort the tasks and faults which
    are of interest to you, keeping tabs on when they're due, how they're
    progressing, how much time is being time-sheeted against them, where there are
    time-effort over-runs, etc.


How do I Manage Project Tasks
-----------------------------

Managing project tasks is essentially a similar exercise to managing
Help Desk tasks.

.. NOTE:: While there are no functional differences between tasks assigned in
          'help desk' type projects or tasks assigned to more traditional
          'life-cycle' projects, these are sometimes managed differently, or by
          different people within an organization. Life-cycle projects
          generally have a beginning and middle and an end, and in general, are
          managed by a single project manager. The nature of the processes used
          to manage such tasks is therefore related to these attributes


How do I Modify a Task's Interested Parties List for an Existing Comment Thread?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the Task that you want to modify the list of Interested Parties
    for.

#.  Click on the Comments tab for this Task, to be taken to the Comments
    page.

#.  Find the beginning of the conversation thread that you want to
    modify, as denoted by [ External Conversation ] or [ Internal
    Conversation ]

#.  Click on the [ External Conversation ] or [ Internal Conversation ]
    text, to reveal a drop-down list-box.

#.  Click on the drop-down list-box to reveal a list of Interested
    Parties which can be associated with this comment thread.

#.  Work your way through this list, checking and un-checking the people
    you want to include or remove from the thread.

#.  Once done, click outside of the list-box; the list-box will 'collapse'
    and your changes will be saved.


How does a Task Re-Open Automatically on New Activity?
------------------------------------------------------

If you've placed a Task in Pending or Closed, that task will be re-activated if
an email is received by the email gateway, from one of the potential *external*
Interested Parties (as defined by the list of email addresses in the Interested
Parties list on the main page of that Task. Email from an *internal* address
will not trigger this state-change.


How do I Import Project Tasks From External Applications?
---------------------------------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the Project that you want to import Tasks into.

#.  Click into the Import/Export tab.

    .. NOTE:: Presently, allocPSA allows you to import a specifically formatted
              Comma Separated Value (CSV) text file, or a project from Gnome
              Planner ( https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Planner ). You can select
              what type of file you're about to import into the project using
              the File Type drop-list. The information link beside this
              drop-list provides more details about the options.

#.  You can choose the file you want to import via the import field. Click on
    the 'Browse...' button to be offered a File Open dialog box, with which you
    can navigate to the file that you want to import.

#.  Once you've choosen the file to import, click on the 'Open' button. This
    will now add the tasks in the import file to this Project.


How do I Export Project Tasks?
------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Go to the Project that you want to Export Task data from.

#.  Click into the Import/Export tab.

    .. NOTE:: Presently, allocPSA allows you to export a specifically formatted
              Comma Separated Value (CSV) text file, or a project file
              compatible with Gnome Planner (
              https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Planner ).

#.  To export the Project's task data as a Gnome Project file, click on
    the 'GNOME Planner format XML file' link. This will present you with a
    File Save dialog, with which you can save your project data file or open
    it in Gnome Project.

#.  To export the Project's task data as a Comma Separated Value (CSV)
    text file, click on the 'comma separated values (task names, estimated
    hours, engineers)' link. This will present you with a File Save dialog,
    with which you can save your project data file or open it in a text
    editor.


How do I Search for Task Contents?
----------------------------------

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Enter the text that you are looking for in the Search text-box, near the
    top-right of the main allocPSA screen. (This normally has a greyed-out text
    string which says 'Enter search text or ID...').

#.  If you are looking for contents which are likely to be in the 'header' part
    of the task, you can select Search Tasks from the drop-list which is on the
    left of the Search text-box.

#.  If you are looking for contents which are likely to be in the Comments
    section of the task, select Search Comments from the drop-list which is on
    the left of the Search text-box.

#.  Once you've supplied both the text to search for and specified where to
    search, press the Enter key on your keyboard.

#.  The search results will be presented on-screen for you to peruse.

.. NOTE:: allocPSA has a sophisticated search lexicon which you can use to hone
          your searches. For more information, read the `Search`_ section of
          this document.


How do I Quickly Add Time Sheet Entries?
----------------------------------------

.. NOTE:: In order to make use of this facility, you need to switch on the New
          Time Sheet Item option for your Home page. The New Time Sheet Item
          feature provides a text-entry box on the user's Home page. This will
          allow a user to quickly add time-sheet line items for either an
          existing time-sheet, or it will spawn a new time-sheet for in the
          project which corresponds with the task that the user will add time
          for.

.. NOTE:: To learn how to enable this feature on your Home page, please refer
          to `How do I Customise my Home Page?`_ .

#.  Log in to allocPSA.

#.  Click into your Home page tab.

#.  In the New Time Sheet Item text-box, enter a value for the:

    #.  Duration - in the standard time increments for that user (eg,
        hours).
    #.  Task ID - the ID of the task that you want to add this time-sheet
        item for.
    #.  Comment - an optional note relating to the work being done for
        this time-sheet item.


    .. NOTE:: As you're typing these details into the textbox, allocPSA will
              being rendering them into a time-sheet hint entry, in the lower
              part of the information block, showing you the details in a
              fuller-form.

#.  Once you're satisfied that the information you've entered and had
    presented back to you is correct, press the Enter key. This will cause
    allocPSA to accept the material you've provided, and add it as a
    line-item for the corresponding time-sheet.

Useful Tips for using allocPSA
==============================

Firstly, remember that allocPSA is a web-based application. As such, all the
normal behaviour that you would expect from a web-browser functions correctly
in allocPSA. Therefore:

#.  When you are viewing a page which is larger than the web-browser window, you
    can always scroll down (and up) with the scrollbar or Page Up or Page Down
    on your keyboard.

#.  You can print whole or part of a page to any printer your workstation has
    been configured to use, at any time, just like you would print a web-page.
    If you see a "Print" link at the top of the screen that indicates that
    particular pages have been optimised for printing.

#.  You can find any piece of text in a page by using your browser's page Find
    function (often a ``Ctrl + f`` or ``Command + f`` keystroke)

#.  You can save the complete contents of a page to a file, for later review, by
    using your browser's Save Page As... function (often a ``Ctrl + s`` or
    ``Command + s`` keystroke)

#.  You can trace your steps back to any specific point that you have been
    during this session, by using your browser's Back button.

#.  You can establish specific browser Bookmarks for particular, commonly used
    Projects, Tasks or function pages in allocPSA

#.  You can (with some care) send others within your organization the current
    web-browser address (i.e. URL) of a particularly interesting page in
    allocPSA that you want them to see.

#.  Your organization can make some parts of allocPSA available to outsiders,
    via an extranet system, which may help them better understand how their
    Project with your firm is progressing.

#.  You can Bookmark pages in your web-browser. e.g.: if you establish a
    specific filter, with options, for showing Tasks, bookmark it, and recall
    the same filter settings on future occasions.

.. NOTE:: It is a good idea to bookmark at least one allocPSA page in your
          web-browser, and this should be your regular, 'safe' and 'sane' view
          of tasks, perhaps the list of currently open Faults or active and
          open Tasks, with minimal output fields selected. The main reason to
          create such a book mark is that if, by some chance, you select to
          display a very large result set, by selecting perhaps too much
          output, or too liberal a filter, there could be a huge volume of data
          returned. In some web-server <-> web-browser combinations, this might
          cause timeouts. If you do find yourself in such a scenario, you can
          use your 'sane' bookmark, to 'reset' the task filter into something
          manageable.

A Note on Dates in allocPSA
---------------------------

As this system is intended for use in multiple countries, it has been designed
to work with International Standards Organisation (ISO) standard dates, which
are in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. Thus the 11th of November, 2011 is displayed
as 2011-11-11.

A note on viewing levels and privileges
---------------------------------------

allocPSA has a strict notion of what functions are visible and permissible to
various user levels. While this manual describes all functions which are
available, some (or many) may not be visible to users who do not have the
appropriate access privileges.


allocPSA Tab Menu
=================

The tab menu in allocPSA is at the top of every page of the application. It is
perhaps the most often used component of the allocPSA application. From this
tab bar, you will be able to jump directly to almost all the main application
modules (Home, Projects, Clients, Tasks, Finances, etc.) There is also a search
facility with which you will be able to look for almost all important data-sets
archived in allocPSA. Finally, there is also an Quick List, from which, you
will be able to create new Tasks, Project, Client entries, as well as see a
list of recently visited pages of the allocPSA application.


Home
----

The Home page is a convenient one-stop spot for you to determine the status of
your Tasks, calendar, cost-centre(s), pending work items, messages, Time Sheets
and any organization-wide announcements that have been made. For really simple
usage, can operate much of allocPSA from the main screen; many of the other
top-level screens are often function-specific enhancements of the Home screen.

Top Tasks
~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/top_tasks.png

    A list of tasks, this displays as many tasks as you configure it to.

This section shows you as many tasks as you configure it to. They are only tasks assigned to you.


Calendar
~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/calendar.png

    The calendar shows tasks, reminders and absences.

The Calendar will show you a date-centric view of the current week, fortnight,
month, etc. Tasks which are due to begin or finish which fall on specific days,
will be shown in here, as well as any Reminders which have been set up or
Absences which are scheduled.

You can view the details of any single Task by clicking on that Task. You can
modify the date-range shown within the calendar by clicking on the single
or multi-week options shown. Only your Tasks are shown in the calendar. As with
all other parts of allocPSA, you can print this page, including your full
calendar, to any printer configured on your workstation. You can create new
Tasks, reminders or absences by clicking on any of the three icons that are in
the top-left hand corner of each day in the calendar.

Project List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/project_list.png

    The table above listed all the new Projects belonging to their corresponding Clients

allocPSA allows for the management of Projects, among other things. Within your
Home page, allocPSA shows Projects which are allocated to you, the user. The
list shows you the Client that the Project belongs to, which can be an internal
Client, within your organization, or an external Client.

The Project name, which you can click on to jump to that particular Project, a
link to the list of Tasks for that particular Project, as well as link to the
Task Graph, for a that Project.

For more information, please refer to the 'Project' section.


Tagged Funds
~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA uses the concept of Cost Centres (called Tagged Funds) to show,
maintain, and track the financial state of each Project's or Person's accounts.

As a Professional Services Automation system, allocPSA must keep track of both
the expenses and revenues of a Project as well as cost-centres for individual
consultants and resources. It does so with a form of cost centre called a
tagged fund (TF for short). In this home page view, a user will be shown their
own personal tagged fund account balance, as well as the present balance of any
Projects they have been allocated to oversee financially.

Click the account name you want to view in greater detail, and you will be
taken to that account. The account information page is described in detail
elsewhere in this document, but suffice to say that it displays and behaves
very much like an online bank account statement, with money being debited and
credited for any number of other accounts and source, reflecting the generation
and processing of Time Sheets, billable hours, Expense Forms and financial
injections from external systems like invoicing etc.


Current Time Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA allows users to submit Time Sheets allocated to specific Projects or
consultancy jobs. The list of Time Sheets shown in the Home page is the list of
Time Sheets which are presently still being edited or worked on by the user. In
other words, they are in progress.

Click the link of the Time Sheet status to enter into the current
Time Sheet.


Time Sheet Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides each user with a quick overview of time-sheet metrics, offering
data on how much work was captured in time-sheets for Today, Yesterday,
the Last 2 weeks, and a rolling 2 week average.


New Time Sheet Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've switched on this option, allocPSA can provide you with a
quick-and-easy mechanism for adding time-sheet data. For more on how to
use this facility, see: `How do I Quickly Add Time Sheet Entries?`_ .


New Time Sheet Item Hint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have manager privileges and if you've switched on this option, allocPSA
can provide you with a quick-and-easy mechanism for noting when you believe
specific staff are working on specific tasks, which could then be used to
ensure appropriate billing information is captured. For more on how to use this
facility, see: `How do I Ensure Staff Effort on Tasks is Captured as Time
Sheets?`_ .


Clients
-------

.. figure:: images/client_list.png

    List(s) of current, potential and archived Clients are
    shown in the Clients section of allocPSA.

All Professional Services Organisations (PSO) have a notion of Clients. This
normally includes all main companies and organizations that the PSO has contact
with. allocPSA has the ability to track all current, potential and archived
(i.e. lapsed) Clients. Besides the core organizational information, any number
of contacts can also be entered for each organization tracked. The information
maintained includes the Client Name, Contact Name, Contact Phone, Contact
E-mail, etc.

allocPSA also allows for the attachment of documents which pertain to this
Client, as well as any per-Client reminders that need to be added.

To view the list of current Clients, you need to click on the 'Clients' tab in
the allocPSA main menu. You will then be taken to the Clients tab page, where
you will be shown a table of current Clients.

You can filter the list of clients shown in the Clients tab page, by clicking
the Show Filter link, if this is presented, which will open up the filter
segment of the page. Using this filter, you can select portions of a client
name or a contact name within a client organization, which you want to filter
on, along with the client's Status (Current, Potential, Archived) and the
client's Category (Client, Vendor, Supplier, Non-profit, etc.).

Once you have selected the filter criteria, you click the Filter button, and
allocPSA will show you the matching entries. You can remove a filter, by
clearing out the values in the filter text boxes, and clicking the Filter
button once more.

You can also use the alphabetic quick-links shown at the bottom of the filter
segment, to show all the client organizations which start with A, B, C, etc.

You can view and edit details for each Client, by clicking on that client's
link.

.. Hint:: When allocPSA lists the list of current Client's, you can use your
          browser's Find facility (usually ``Ctrl + f`` or ``Command + f``
          keystroke) to find any piece of text in this page. Thus, if you know
          that the surname of the contact that you want is Purcell, you can
          quickly locate this contact and jump straight to that contact's
          details on this Client list page.

If you want to view the list of Potential Clients, you can change the drop-list
which specifies Client type, and press the 'Filter' button. The same process
can be used to list All or Archived Clients.

.. Hint:: If you have nominated a primary contact for a Client, then that
          primary contact's details will be shown in the Client listing. If
          those details include an email address, that email address will be
          hyperlinked, so that you can click on it to send that person mail,
          straight from within your mail Client. You will note that much like
          Task and Project forms, the Client forms have a header component, as
          well as the body or main component. The header is used to store
          information for the company or organization which is common to all of
          the contacts, such as headquarters address details, main switch and
          fax number.

.. figure:: images/client.png

    Each Client record is defined as a Client organization detail header and
    any number of contacts, reminders, documents, comments, etc.

.. figure:: images/client_contact.png

    For each Client you can have as many contacts as you liked. Just click the
    "New Client Contact" link in the top right hand corner of the Client
    Contact box, fill in the details and then click the "Save Client Contact"
    button. You can designate one Client Contact to be the Primary, which will
    make it then show up on the Client tab list.

Adding a Primary Contact to a Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The body of the Client form consists of as many contacts as you care to add.
There's no real limit. Further, you can specify which of the contacts is the
primary contact. This will be the person whose details will appear in the main
Client page table list of Clients and the contacts. You can also specify each
contacts specific particulars, such as their personal contact numbers,
mobile/cell-phone numbers, email addresses, as well as their physical address,
if this is different from the main address listed in the Client header record
(perhaps they work from a branch-office.)

Adding Notes to a Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/client_comment.png

    Add as many free-form comments as you need to a Client record. Just click
    the "New Comment" link in the top right hand corner.

allocPSA provides the facility to add Client-level status notes to your
Project. To do so, simply add text into the 'New Comment' field and click on
the 'Save Comment' button. You can review any existing comments by selecting
them from the comments list, and also update and delete them when they are in
view.

Adding Documents to a Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/client_upload.png

    You can upload documents like images, database files, contracts, etc.


allocPSA allows you to add electronic documents to a Client's record. These
documents could be contracts, letters, scanned images, business-plans, or
database files. All forms of electronic document are supported (PDF files,
ASCII, HTML, all graphics files, MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel and LibreOffice
to name but a few.) These documents are then displayed in a list on the
Project page, and can be downloaded or viewed very easily and quickly.
Further, if your web-browser is able, it will either display the uploaded
document within the browser, or launch a helper application to display the
document on screen, which greatly facilitates easy retrieval and viewing.

To add a document to the Project document 'tree', you can click on the 'Choose'
button which is visible on the 'Clients' page. This will bring up a File
Open-style dialog box (depending on your web-browser) with which you can
navigate to the document that you want to upload to allocPSA's document
repository. When you have selected the file you want to upload, and are back to
allocPSA's Project page, you should see the file path specified in the
file-upload textbox. You can then click the 'Save Document' button, and your
web-browser will upload the file to allocPSA. This process may take a moment,
particularly if you have a large file.

Adding Reminders to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a new reminder to the Client Project (rather than to just a
specific Task) by clicking on the 'Add Reminder' link on the 'Clients' page.

.. figure:: images/new_reminder.png

    Remainders can even be linked to Clients

Reminders are a wonderfully useful facility in allocPSA. They can be set within
the context of a Client, rather than a Project or Task.

Listing and Adding Projects to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the existing, and add new projects to this client, by clicking
into the Projects tab. This will show you the current, pending and archived
projects related to this client. You can also create a new project, linked to
this client, by clicking the New Project link, and then completing the
process required to add a new project.


Listing and Adding Invoices to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use allocPSA to generate and manage your invoices to clients, you can
manage these from the client's Invoices tab.  This will show you a list of
invoices related to this client, and by clicking the New Invoice link, you will
be able to add a new invoice to this list.


Listing and Adding Sales to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the existing, and add new sales entities to this client, by
clicking into the Sales tab. This will show you all the sales related to this
client. You can also create a new sale item, linked to this client, by clicking
the New Sale link, and then completing the process required to add a new sale.


Finding the Client Address on a Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA has been integrated with Google Maps, so you are able to jump straight
to any client address, by clicking on the View map link, shown on the main
'Clients' page. This will take you straight to the nominated client address, as
rendered by Google maps.


Modifying Client Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to modify the Client header information:

#.  Click the 'Client Name'.

#.  Click the 'Edit Client Details' button to modify the Client header details
    such as name, address etc.

#.  Click on the 'Save' button.

#.  You can also modify the content you want to change or add for the other
    parts, and press appropriate 'Save' or 'Add' buttons

Projects
--------

.. figure:: images/project.png

    A Project's header information.

A Project is a planed undertaking which gets completed by one or more
people/resources working on one or more Tasks. Most Professional Services firms
have very specific examples of what a Project is. It might be implementing a
new computer system for a Client.  It might be the production of a report, or
development of a new device, or piece software. allocPSA is very flexible how
it handles the concept of a Project, and how the life-cycle of a Project is
handled in your organization.

To see a list of Projects in allocPSA, click on the Projects tab on the main
menu.

You can filter the list of projects shown in the Projects tab page by clicking
the Show Filter link which opens the filter pop-up. You can filter projects by
Status (Current, Potential, Archived), Type (Project, Job, Contract), allocated
to a particular person, and portions of a project's name.

Once you have selected the filter criteria, you click the Filter button, and
allocPSA will show you the matching entries. You can remove a filter, by
clearing out the values in the filter text boxes, and clicking the Filter
button once more.

Much like a Task, a Project has a header, which is unlikely to change that
frequently. Within this header is information about the Project; including the
Project's name, who the Client is, Project-specific details about the Client's
contact person, a number of start and finish dates, along with Project budget
details, Project manager (for Time Sheet sign off purposes) and the Project
history.

You can set per-Project assignment of Commission (used for tracking revenues to
account managers of salespeople within your firm.) You can also set which
resources/staff are assigned to work on this Project. Unless a staff user is
assigned to a Project, they will not be able to view it or its attendant Tasks
and phases (unless they have manager security privileges.) When establishing
the staff resources who will work on this Project, you can also specify what
their charge rates are.

allocPSA allows for the flexible management of in-house per-Project rates, as
well as externally charged rates which then bring revenues into particular
staff, Project or departmental cost-centres (known as Tagged Funds or TFs).

allocPSA also allows you to upload (and attach) any type of electronic document
to this Project's repository, as well as set up Project-specific Reminders.

These are the available options for the header:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Project
     - The name of this particular Project. Provide a name which is reasonably
       memorable clearly understandable and readable . Doesn't matter if it's
       a little long.
   - - Project Nick Name
     - If the Project Name is long and can be contracted or acronymised,
       provide a short name for easy reference here.
   - - Description
     - A detailed account of what this Project is all about. This makes it easy
       for new resource to quickly get up to speed with the Project, and can
       help staff who are on dozens of similar Projects quickly identify the
       aims and deliverables of this particular Project.
   - - Priority
     - Specify a priority (used for prioritisation sorting.) Level 1 is the
       highest priority in allocPSA. The levels are '1. Critical', '2.
       Important', '3. Normal', '4. Minor', and '5. Wishlist'.
   - - Status
     - Which should be either Current, Potential or Archived. Only Current
       Projects are displayed by default to users of allocPSA. Potential
       Projects are still being pitched for, and Archived Projects are
       available for review, but aren't active.
   - - Type
     - Which should be either Contract, Job or Project. Most Professional
       Services firms perform work on either a Contract (support contract,
       long-term ongoing work or staff on-site basis), Job (short term work or
       consultancy) or Project (multi-person, with specified beginning, middle
       and end, and more likely to be fixed cost and on a timeline with
       milestones and deliverables.) If you select a Project, allocPSA
       establishes a number of boilerplate phases, which you can use, extend
       or delete as you deem fit.
   - - Client
     - The name of the Client which may have already been added to allocPSA's
       Client database, or, if new, can be added by clicking "New Client".
       Remember, many Projects and jobs are for internal Clients. As such,
       your internal Clients should be added in allocPSA's Client database
       too.
   - - Client Contact
     - The Client's contact representative. This is on a per-Project basis,
       which may be different from the main contact(s) listed in the Client
       database.
   - - Estimated Start
     - The estimated date you plan to start the Project.
   - - Actual Start
     - The actual date you started the Project.
   - - Estimated Completion
     - The estimated date you plan to finish the Project.
   - - Actual Completion
     - The actual date you finished the Project
   - - Budget
     - You can set the Project Budget amount here using different currency such
       as AUD, USD, NZD, CAD etc. This figure is used to determine the
       percentage of Project budget which has presently been spent, which is a
       useful metric for Project managers and the professional service firm's
       management. For example, if only half the Project has been completed,
       and 60% of the budget has been spent thus far, there are likely to be
       budget constraint or blow-out problems further down the track.
   - - Default Task Limit
     - The initial limit of time budget set for each task.
   - - Default Interested Parties
     - The initial default group of people who should be on the
       Interested Parties list of each new task.
   - - Client Billed At
     - The rate at which customers are billed.
   - - Default timesheet rate
     - The default rate that new resources on the project are allocated
       per unit of work.
   - - Default timesheet unit
     - The default unit of time that new resources have their
       time-sheeting set to (hour, day, etc.)
   - - Cost Centre TF
     - If this Project has an associated Project cost-centre, either
       specifically established for the purposes and life-cycle of this
       Project, or a more generic one, to be used by multiple Projects which
       are thematically linked, this cost-centre can be specified here.

After you have finished all the details:

#.  Press the 'Save' button to create your new Project and then...

#.  Add resources and add new comments for Modification History, Commission To,
    Project People, uploading Project Files, creating a New Task, adding
    Reminders or generating New Time Sheets, Transactions.

A Project made of one or more people/staff undertaking numerous Tasks. Tasks
can be active (i.e. not-complete) or archived (i.e. completed).  Normally,
allocPSA's Project page will only show you the current (i.e.
active/non-complete) Task list. You can use the complete Task list, or the
Project's Task Graph or the Task Allocation Report. A Project will also allow
you to specify people/staff/resources, commissions and attach documents, which
we will see how to manage later on.

Adding Notes to your Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA can keep notes on each project. Just go to the 'Comments' tab and add
comments.

Project Sales Commission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In many professional services organizations, sales commissions are allocated
for the business development efforts. In allocPSA, these sales commissions are
tracked on a per-Project basis. The Project manager may establish one or more
staff/resources from your organization who will receive the sales commission.
To add a percentage commission to a specified staff member, select their name
from the drop-list at left, then add the 'Commission %' in the text-box, then
click on the 'Add' button. This will add that staff member as a commission
holder in this Project.  You can add more staff-members as commission-holders
by following this simple procedure.

Adding Staff Resource to your Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/project_people.png

    Staff can be added or deleted to a Project according to your needs.

You can add as many people/resource to your Project as you wish. To do so,
simply click on the 'People' link next to 'Commissions' which displays the
'Project People' segment of the Project form. You will note that the last row
(or if only one row exists, the first row) of the resource entries is a blank
in the 'Person' drop-list.  You can select the person you wish to add, the type
of email notifications they will receive for this Project: none, only for Tasks
assigned to them, and if this person is the Project's manager, perhaps for all
Project Tasks.

Complete Task List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This shows the total list of all existing Tasks for this Project.

To view this list, click on the 'Tasks' link in the Project you are in.
allocPSA shows a (possibly long) list of Tasks, which you can click on
individually, to view and edit. You can always return to the normal Project
view by clicking the Back button on your browser or clicking on the 'Project'
link at top.

Task Graph - Project Task Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is like the Complete Task List, except it is a graphical representation of
the timeline of the Tasks and Phases, as well as a list of the existing Tasks
for this particular Project. It can be used as a very simple facsimile of a
Gantt chart for planning purposes. As with all things in allocPSA, you will
always able to print this page to any printers you have configured.

To view this list, click on the 'Graph' link in the Project you are in. You get
a (possibly large) graph with coloured lines, and a (possibly long) list of
Tasks, which you can click on individually, to view and edit.

The graph shows dates and the names of the Tasks and phases along the left-hand
side. This information showed is:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Target Task Period
     - The Target Task Period is a period of time you set for the Task
       completion, from start to finish.
   - - Actual Task Period
     - The Actual Task Period is the actual time you use to complete that
       particular Task, from start to finish.
   - - Forecast Task Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your Task completion, based on percentage
       complete estimates, the date duration spent thus far, and the number of
       hours allocated to this Task.
   - - Start Date (completion date not known)
     - This is a right-heading triangle showing the starting date of the Task
       or phase which has no completion date set. Therefore no target, actual,
       and forecast period will be shown.
   - - Completion Date (start date not known)
     - This is a left-heading triangle showing the completion date of the Task
       or phase without any start date having been set. Again, no target,
       actual, and forecast period will be shown.
   - - Target Phase Period
     - The Target Phase Period is a period of time you set for the entire phase
       completion. It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Actual Phase Period
     - The Actual Phase Period is the actual time you use to complete the
       entire phase. . It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Forecast Phase Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your phase completion. allocPSA will attempt to
       mathematically estimate the forecast completion phase period based on
       the time and percentage complete estimates supplied within its child
       Tasks.

The Project's phases and Tasks display in a list below the graph. The child
Tasks of any parent Task or phase is indented below that parent. Clicking on
any of these will bring it to the screen.

Task Allocation Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Task Allocation Reports are similar to Task Graphs. The difference being, each
user/resource's allocation of Tasks gets listed and displayed in their own
separate graphs. You can use this report to find possible overload work for
specific people/resources in your Projects.

To view the list, click on the 'Allocation' link in the Project you are in. You
get one or more large graphs with coloured lines, and a possibly long list of
Tasks, which you can click on individually, to view and edit.

All staff on the Project are graphed, with a list of their tasks below their
name.

The graph shows the dates along the top, and the names of the Tasks and phases
along the left-hand side. This is what is graphed:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Target Task Period
     - The Target Task Period is a period of time you set for the Task
       completion, from start to finish.
   - - Actual Task Period
     - The Actual Task Period is the actual time you use to complete that
       particular Task, from start to finish.
   - - Forecast Task Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your Task completion, based on percentage
       complete estimates, the date duration spent thus far, and the number of
       hours allocated to this Task.
   - - Start Date (completion date not known)
     - This is a right-heading triangle showing the starting date of the Task
       or phase which has no completion date set. Therefore no target, actual,
       and forecast period will be shown.
   - - Completion Date (start date not known)
     - This is a left-heading triangle showing the completion date of the Task
       or phase without any start date having been set. Again, no target,
       actual, and forcast period is shown.
   - - Target Phase Period
     - The Target Phase Period is a period of time you set for the entire phase
       completion. It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Actual Phase Period
     - The Actual Phase Period is the actual time you use to complete the
       entire phase. . It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Forecast Phase Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your phase completion. allocPSA will attempt to
       mathematically estimate the forecast completion phase period based on
       the time and percentage complete estimates supplied within its child
       Tasks.

The Project's phases and Tasks for each specific user/resource are in a list
below the graph. The child Tasks of any parent Task or phase are indented below
that parent. Clicking on any of these will bring it to the screen.


List of the Current Uncompleted Tasks in a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within a Project or from the Tasks view, you can drill down into Tasks that are
not complete. These Tasks may be tracking well or may be overdue. When overdue,
allocPSA flags them in brighter colours for obvious recognition.

New Task
~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/task_detail.png

    When adding new Tasks, you fill out the Task header.

Allows you to create a new Task for this particular Project.

Whenever you are in a Project, and can see the 'New Task' link, clicking on it
presents a new blank Task screen, which you can then fill out and save. Any
Tasks created this way will automatically belong to the Project you are
currently viewing.

Adding Reminders to Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a new reminder to the Project (not just a specific Task or Client)
by clicking on the New Reminder link on the Project page

Reminders are a wonderfully useful facility in allocPSA. They can be set
globally, within the context of a Project (so that they stop being sent when
the Project is complete) and within the context of a Task, (so that they stop
being sent when that Task or its parent Project is complete.) You can set
reminders for yourself, for other resources working on the Project, or for the
Project team (such as, to remind everyone of a Project meeting, or of a weekly
Time Sheet submission policy.)

Uploading Documents to Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA allows you to add electronic documents to a Project. These could be
specification documents, scanned images of signed contracts, or manuals. All
forms of electronic document are supported (PDF files, ASCII, HTML, all
graphics files, MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, MDF files, and OpenDocument files
to name but a few.) These documents are then displayed in a list on the Project
page, and can be downloaded or viewed very easily and quickly. Further, if your
web-browser is able to, it will either display the uploaded document within the
browser, or launch a help application to display the document on-screen, which
greatly facilitates easy retrieval and viewing.

To add a document to the Project document 'tree', go to 'Attachments' and click
on the 'Browse' button. This will bring up a File Open-style dialog box
(depending on your web-browser) with which you can navigate to the document
that you want to upload to allocPSA's document repository. When you have
selected the file you want to upload, and are back to allocPSA's Project page,
you should see the file path specified in the file-upload textbox. You can then
click the 'Upload Attathment' button, and your web-browser will upload the file
to allocPSA. This process may take a moment, particularly if you have a large
file.


Adding a Time Sheet to a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most services organizations, Time Sheets are used to co-ordinate the billing
(internally or externally) of staff/resource times and for paying of
staff/resources. A user can create Time Sheets from within the Project in
question. Any Time Sheets made this way are automatically attached to the
current Project. See the Time Sheets section for further details on how to
create and manage Time Sheets.

Project Expense Forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to raise a Project-specific cost, you can create one with
allocPSA's Expense Form (described later in this manual.) All such expenses
will appear on your Project's Transactions section.


Tasks
-----

.. figure:: images/task.png

    A Task can have its specific details, reminders and comments

A Task is a piece of work to be done, usually related to a specific Project.
Tasks normally have start and finish dates, and are allocated to one specific
user (i.e. a user resource in Project management parlance). Tasks can have
associated descriptions, as well as priorities, and be under a Parent Task.
Tasks can also have a number of user-created comments, which provide some
history about the Task.

A Task can have Reminders associated with it which can email the specified
owner of the Task, or others within that Project, on certain dates and at
certain times.


Special Tasks: Faults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In allocPSA a fault is a special kind of Task which can be tracked specifically
as the entity which relates to help-desk activities within allocPSA.

Outside this change in 'type' faults are actioned, managed, and behave like any
standard task.

.. NOTE:: When you create a fault, you may create an automated reminder for the
          assignee. The priority of the fault will set how often these reminder
          emails get sent.

While allocPSA does not purport to be a full Service Desk solution, the
tracking of faults as part of the overall system framework provides a powerful
system for companies which offer service-level support to track, manage, filter
and archive any issues or problems which arise in the day-to-day operation of
any services organization.


Special Tasks: Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In allocPSA a message is a special kind of Task which can be tracked
specifically as the entity which relates to quick notes for users to take
actions, such as calling others.

Outside this change in task 'type', messages are actioned, managed and behave
like any standard task. With one exception. Any messages created for a user,
will appear in a separate Messages segment of the user's Home page.

.. NOTE:: When you create a message, you make an automated reminder for the
          assignee. The priority of the message will decide how often these
          reminder emails get sent.


General Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks in allocPSA have a number of views. When creating a new Task you get a
view which primarily shows the header information. Once saved, viewing that
Task displays the normal working view of the Task, with the header information
read-only.

You can process the Task through its normal workflow, by adding comments upon
each atomic action of the Tasks history, adding time and eventually closing the
Task when it's complete.


.. figure:: images/task_detail.png

    Task header, allowing you to specify the Project, Task name, description, interested parties and dates.

Tasks have two views. The first view is the header view, in which most
attributes don't usually change. The header view only shows a limited subset of
all the information which is normally associated with a Task. Once you have
supplied whatever information you have and ensured that the Task has a name,
you should be able to Save the header, and allocPSA will then take this
information and display it in read-only form, while opening a number of new
attributes which you can now set or change. You may always re-enable editing of
the Task header, by clicking on the 'Edit' link at the top of any fully
specified Task.

If you are creating a New Task, or are updating a Task, you may see any of the
following data fields:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Task*
     - The name of this particular Task. Provide a name which is reasonably
       memorable, descriptive and readable
   - - Priority
     - Specify a priority (used for prioritisation sorting.) Level Critical is the
       highest priority in allocPSAi, and Normal is the default.
   - - Task Type
     - Select a Task type; Task, phase, message or fault. A phase is handled
       much the same as a Task, but displayed in different colour in charts.
       Messages and faults are handled differently, Some Tasks or phases are
       (or have) milestones. For example, code releases or document
       deliverables. As such, they need to be clearly displayed as important
       date-points in online graphs. Setting a milestone for this Task will
       result in a special vertical bar to be drawn in the Project Graph.
   - - Project
     - Which Project is this Task associated with. Normally left to the default
       (current) Project, but can be assigned to any other Project
   - - Parent Task
     - Select a parent Task (or phase) if this particular Task is a sub-Task.
   - - Description
     - A full account of what this Task is about. Provide as much detail as you
       can.
   - - Tags
     - The alloc tagging system. You can use as many tags as you need on a
       task. Create a tag but pressing new.
   - - Possible Duplicates
     - A list of possible duplicate tasks.
   - - Status
     - Set the status for the task.
   - - Managed By
     - The task manager.
   - - Assigned to
     - The user that is assigned the task.
   - - Default Interested Parties
     - allocPSA allows you to specify which other members of the Project (which
       the Task belongs to) as well as any Client contacts listed for the
       nominated Project Client, should be included in automated emails which
       are sent. This is a great way to keep a whole team of in-house and
       external resource briefed on the Task status.  NOTE: Naturally, you and
       your staff need to be mindful of what messages are sent to these
       external resources.
   - - Time Estimate Hours (Best/Worst/Expected)
     - Time estimated to finish this Task. It is measured in terms of hour
       units. This figure helps allocPSA produce Project timeline estimates and
       forecasts. It does not need to be the same as the final time effort
       which results in an entry in a Time Sheet.
   - - Estimator
     - The person that made the estimate, usually this is filled out
       automatically.
   - - Actual Hours
     - The actual hours that have been spent on this task so far.
   - - Effort Limited To
     - Work that is time sheeted for Tasks that have a Time Limit set will
       be flagged red if they go over their Time Limit Hours.
   - - Target Start
     - The estimated date you plan to start the Task. Click on the button at
       right to automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and
       to minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01
   - - Actual Start
     - The actual date you started the Task . Click on the button at right to
       automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and to
       minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01
   - - Target Completion
     - The estimated date you plan to finish the Task. Click on the button at
       right to automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and
       to minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01
   - - Actual Completion
     - The actual date you finished the Task . Click on the button at right to
       automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and to
       minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01

Fill in all the information needed, than press the 'Save' button to create this
new Task. You will then be shown the normal editable Task view which is for
editing Tasks. In general, the header, or top part of the Task don't modifying,
but additions can be made to the Task by way of Comments. You can now add such
Comment updates (as they arise) to this Task, and change the percentage
complete status where necessary.

You can add as many comments as you like. All comments are stamped for
date-time and username. You can also edit (or delete) a comment, by selecting
it from the comments list to display it in the comments edit box, then updating
or deleting it.


Adding Reminders to Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/new_reminder.png

    Add reminders for you and other members of the Project.

Reminders are a wonderfully useful facility in allocPSA. They can be set
globally, within the context of a Project (so that they stop being sent when
the Project is complete,) and within the context of a Task, (so that they stop
being sent when the Project is complete.) You can set reminders for yourself,
for other resources working on the Project, or for the whole Project team
together (for example, to remind every one of a Project meeting, or of a weekly
Time Sheet submission policy.)


Closing a Task When Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have finished all aspects of a Task, you are able to mark it complete.
To do this, click the Edit Task button at bottom of the page, to enable changes
to the task header, and enter a date for Actual Completion. As per-usual, you
can add today's date in the Actual Completion field, by double-clicking on it
with your mouse. Alternatively, you can select one of the Closed options from
the Status drop-list.


Time
----

.. figure:: images/timeSheet_new.png

.. figure:: images/timeSheet_items.png

The allocPSA Time Sheet system is designed to make it easy for staff/employees
to keep track of their time. This is the default work flow:

#.  You create a time sheet, adding the project which the time sheet is for.

#.  Next time is added to the time sheet.

#.  The time sheet is then pushed to the manager.

    .. NOTE:: The manager(s) are set on the project 'People' page.

#.  Once the manager has reviewed the time sheet, they push the time sheet to
    the administrator. If there is a problem, they can push it back to the
    time sheet submitter.

#.  When the administrator receives the time sheet, they review it and can make
    an invoice if they so desire.


Adding New Time Sheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#.  From the action 'Quick List' drop list on the allocPSA toolbar, select 'New
    Time Sheet' link.

#.  Choose the Project that this Time Sheet belongs to.

#.  Click 'Create Time Sheet'.

#.  Create Time Sheet items.

    .. HINT:: Time Sheets items are individual line items, pertaining to
              specific Tasks. For instance, you may have worked for 3 hours on
              one problem (Task A), 2 hours on Task B and 1 hour on Task C, all
              for the one Client.

#.  For each Time Sheet line item, fill in Date, Duration, Task and Location.

    .. HINT:: If the Task you need to link a Time Sheet line item to doesn't
              exist yet, you can create it by clicking on the 'New Task' link.

#.  Press the 'Add' button to add each new item.

#.  Repeat step 6 to add more line item entries if needed.

#.  Press 'Time Sheet to Manager' button when done. An email goes to the person
    designated as the next stop in the Time Sheet workflow process.

    .. HINT:: You can save the Time Sheet as-is, then return to it later on.

    .. HINT:: You can track the progress of your Time Sheets from the 'Time
              Sheet' section of your 'Homepage'.

    .. HINT:: If you're a manager designated to receive requests to authorise
              Time Sheets, you can view them from the 'Time Sheet' section of
              your 'Homepage'.

Submitted Time Sheets go to either the project manager or the financial
administrator. The manager or administrator either approve or reject the time
sheet, and may create an invoice using the time sheet.

.. NOTE:: You can, at any point, elect to send comment email to others, and
          even attach this time-sheet to that email. For information on this,
          see How do I Email a Time-Sheet to Customers?
          How_do_I_Email_a_Time-Sheet_to_Customers_


Printing Time Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the links in the top right hand corner to generate a PDF version of the
Time Sheet which conforms to the Australian government standards for Tax
Invoices.

Adding a Time Sheet within a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a Time Sheet from within a Project.

#.  To create a new Time Sheet, enter the Project which you want to add the
    Time Sheet to.

#.  Enter the details and add a Time Sheet header.

#.  Add individual Time Sheet items, specifying charge rates, durations, dates
    and locations.

Reviewing Existing Time Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also review existing Time Sheets you've created.

#.  From the toolbar, click on the 'Time Sheet' link.

#.  Decide on what Project, Status, Date From you want to filter within.
    Normally the results page will show those Time Sheets with edit status
    only.  Choose All if you want to see all of them. Users with Admin or
    Manager privileges are able to see other people's Time Sheets by selecting
    the right 'User Name'.

#.  Press the 'Filter' button

#.  Click on the Time Sheet you want to edit

#.  Complete the details needed.

#.  When complete, save or submit the Time Sheet as usual.

Because Time Sheeting is complicated, we've added special help links for
reminders on the page.


Invoices
--------

.. figure:: images/invoice_new.png

    To create a new Invoice select a Client and click the Create Invoice
    button.

.. figure:: images/invoiceItem_new.png

    Once you've created the Invoice header, you can add as
    many Invoice line items as you like to that Invoice.


Adding New Invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The allocPSA invoice system allows for the creation and management of invoices
by financial administrators. It is built around a workflow model which is
established as a 'factory default' when allocPSA is first installed. This model
works as follows.

#. Admin creates an invoice.

#. Add line items.

    .. HINT:: Invoice items can be generic, and/or can be tied directly to a
              Time Sheet by clicking the "From Time Sheet" button, and/or
              invoice items can be tied directly to Expense Forms by clicking
              the "From Expense Form" button.

    .. HINT:: Only Time Sheets at status "Invoice" will appear in the "From
              Time Sheet" Invoice item select box.

    .. HINT:: Only Expense Forms that have their "Seek Client Reimbursement"
              checkbox ticked will appear in the "From Expense Form" select box.

#. Download a PDF and send to client.

#. Click "Approve/Reject".

#. Choose "Not Going To Be Paid", "Pending", or "Paid" and click save.

#. Once the invoice process is completed, click "Invoice to Completed".

    .. HINT:: If you had any Invoice items that were generated "From Time
              Sheets" or "From Expense Form", then the associated Time Sheet or
              Expense Form will have its transactions marked as Paid or
              Rejected (depending on the status of the associated Invoice item)
              and be moved to status Completed once the Invoice is moved to
              status Completed.


Reviewing Existing Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can review existing Invoices you've created.

#.  From the toolbar, click on the 'Invoices' link.

#.  Decide on the criteria by which you want to filter your list of Invoices
    and click the Filter button. Only users with Finance Admin permissions are
    able to see the full totals of Invoices. However, users can see Invoices
    which contain Invoices related to their Time Sheets, or Expense Forms.

#.  Click on the Invoice number of the Invoice you want to review.


Sales
-----


Workflow Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA allows you to add Products and specify Fixed Costs and/or Percentage
Commissions to be auto-generated for any Sales of a particular Product.

#.  An allocPSA user who has "manager" or "admin" permissions creates a Product
    and sets up any related Product Costs or Commissions.

#.  At some point in the future a manager or admin creates a Sale for a
    Product. They can specify if the Sale is related to a particular Client or
    Project.

#.  That manager or admin finalizes the Sale items that are on the Sale and
    moves the Sale to status Allocate.

#.  That same manager or admin should then review the *pending* transactions
    for each Sale item. If the "Total Unallocated" figure is green and equal to
    zero, then the funds from the Sale have been allocated. When satisfied they
    should push the Sale to status Administrator.

#.  The Administrator should then review the Sale to make sure that everything
    is correct and, once satisfied, should *approve* all the transactions and
    finally move the Sale to status Finished.


Fixed Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed Product Costs are the list of monetary transactions that are created when
a Product is sold. They specify a particular amount that will be transferred
between TF's, and may be used to represent certain known expenses that are
generated every time there is a Sale of this Product.


Percentage Commissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Product has a Buy Cost (the amount that you pay to acquire the item), and
a Sale Price (the amount that you charge the customer). The difference between
these two amounts is the Margin/Profit of the Sale.

The margin/profit from each sale can be distributed based on any Percentage
Commissions that you set up. For example, you could set 10% of the sale from a
particular Product go to Alice, perhaps for a finder's fee.


Meta TF's
~~~~~~~~~

When specifying the Product Costs and Commissions, it is possible to select
from the various TF's that the transactions should occur between.

There are also Meta TF's that may be auto-calculated for each sale. There is
the "Meta: Project TF", which defaults to the relevant Project (if any), TF. If
no project is specified as part of this Sale, then this Meta TF will fall back
to whatever you have specified as the "Main Finance TF".

The "Meta: Salesperson TF" allows you to specify transactions that should occur
for the TF of the person who created the Sale. This gives you an easy way to
set up a commission for the person who makes the Sale.


Including or Excluding Tax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When first setting up a Product you may select whether the Sale Price is
inclusive or exclusive of Tax. The Tax amount is the percentage specified on
the Setup screen.

If the Sale Price includes Tax, then when a Sale is made a separate transaction
is created for tax, and the corresponding margin/profit for that Sale will be
smaller.


Default Sale Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#.  Product Sale: [PRODUCT]

    The amount that is incoming from the customer who purchased the Product,
    i.e. the Sale Price. And it will transfer monies from the Incoming TF to
    the Sale's related Project TF (or if no Project is related, then it will
    fall back to the Main Finance TF).

#.  Product Sale Tax: [PRODUCT]

    If Tax is included in the Sale Price, then another transaction will be
    created representing the transfer of the tax amount from the related
    Project's TF (or if there is no related Project, then the Main Finance TF)
    into the nominated Tax TF.

#.  The other transactions that are created are from the Product Costs and
    Commissions that were set up for each Product.



Allocation Figures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each Sale Item on the Sale, a summary box is presented that allows you to
quickly check that all the figures for this item are correct.

.. list-table::

   - - Transactions Outgoing
     - The sum of the transactions that are for the Outgoing TF.
   - - Transactions Incoming
     - The sum of the transactions that are for the Incoming TF. This amount
       should be the same as the Sell Price.
   - - Transactions Other
     - The sum of the other transactions (not including Tax transactions). This
       amount should be the same as the Margin.
   - - Total Unallocated
     - The difference between the Margin and the Transactions Other. This
       amount should be zero.

If all the figures line up and reconcile then this Sale is ready to be
progressed. Otherwise the admin or manager should review this Sale and adjust
the transactions until the figures reconcile correctly.


People
------

People for higher lever user: Provide general information of each personnel.
This includes Name, Last Login, Availability, Task Summary, Graph and On Leave.
It comprises of sending email to personnel.

For both higher and lower level users: Allow Changes of your personal
information including Preferred Payment TF, Skill and Absence Forms, etc.

#.  Availability and On Leave are displayed on the front page.

#.  If you want to see other information like Task Summary, Graph, Skill Matrix
    etc., simply click the link to get into the detail.

Filter Section is the same as that in Tools - Miscellaneous Tools - Company
Wide Skill Matrix. You can have a look at the detail under the section
mentioned in the later part.

You can now change your personal information as well as add or view your
absence from, and allocPSA will take you to this.


Wiki
----

The Wiki in allocPSA is a user-generated knowledge base and communal book. Its
interface and syntax will be familiar to anyone who has created or managed
documentation or content on a wiki on similar content systems.

After clicking the Wiki tab from the main tab menu, you will see the 'WIKI
TREE' content block, which sits on the left-hand side of the screen. This shows
the current documents available in the wiki, along with any
folders/sub-folders/directories. You can select any of the content items, or
folders, by clicking on them.

On the right is the 'HISTORY' content block, which shows a list of change
actions for the selected content item/wiki page.

In the middle is the wiki display area, which will show the marked-up wiki page
rendering of your selected content item. You can click on any wiki page from
the 'WIKI TREE', and it will appear here.

To edit the wiki content item, click the 'Edit' button just beneath the content
display area. This will open the content item in a text-editing area, and
present a simple wiki-text markup toolbar across the top of this area.

You can now modify the content text how you like. If you're familiar with wiki
syntax, you can insert it directly. Alternatively, you can use the markup
toolbar to insert the markup syntax into the text area. You can also start by
using the toolbar to insert items, and learn the wiki syntax as you progress -
it's quite simple.

As an example, to enter text as a top-level heading, click the *H1* toolbar
button. This will insert sample marked-up heading text in the current cursor
position in the text editing area, and highlight the sample text which you will
need to replace with your own.

Some of the toolbar buttons have keyboard accelerators - simply hover your
mouse cursor over one of these buttons to see the corresponding help tooltip.
For example, the *H1* toolbar button uses the Ctrl + 1 keyboard accelerator.
*H2* uses Ctrl + 2, etc. To insert **bold** text, you can use Ctrl + B,
*italic* is Ctrl + I and so forth.

You can preview the changes you've made, without having to commit them, by
clicking the *Preview* toolbar button. The preview page is below your
text-editing area.

When done, you can save your changes by clicking the 'Save' button just below
your text editing area.

Also, you should always consider adding a few words of text explaining the
nature of your changes to this wiki page. Add these in the single-line text
box, just below the wiki page text editing area.

Once you've saved your modified wiki page, you see a rendered version, and the
modification note outlining the nature of the changes will appear in the
'HISTORY' section on the right, along with the name of the allocPSA making the
changes (i.e., you) and the date-time of this change.

Note that to make the 'HISTORY' functionality work, you will need to have a
file version control system installed on the server. Currently allocPSA
supports git, mercurial, or darcs for its VCS. Out of the box allocPSA uses
git. The config option called wikiVCS controls which VCS is used.

Creating a New Wiki Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the *New File* link in the top right hand corner of the wiki screen; you
can also create a new file by linking to a file that doesn't exist, using the
wiki-page link syntax: e.g., [[newfile.txt]]


Wiki Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~

The wiki syntax used in allocPSA is called *markdown* You can get more
information about how to write markdown wikis here:
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

We've added some additional extensions to cover syntax for links and maps.

Here's a quick primer on *markdown*:

- Headings of various levels can be made by following the heading title with an
  'underlining' line of characters, such as: ~, -, _, etc.

- Words can be *italicised* (i.e., emphasised) by putting a single asterisk on
  either side of the word.

- Words can be **bold** (i.e., strongly-emphasised) by putting double-quotes on
  either side of the word.

- Links can be made to other wiki pages, by putting the file-name of the target
  wiki page in double-square-brackets: i.e., [[ ]]

allocPSA has been written such that any programmer can "drop-in" a new wiki
syntax. At the moment, the code needs to be modified in order for this to
happen. The allocPSA development team hopes to eventually make it easy to make
this change via a config option.


Inbox
-----

allocPSA provides a facility for accessing the current inbox for the
primary account used to sent mail to the gateway.

Normally, this Inbox contains all the mail incoming into allocPSA, which
allocPSA then processes and remove from the inbox. However, there are
occasions when that email can't be properly processed by allocPSA, such
as when there are no identifying mechanisms in the email header (e.g, a
missing 'key'). Under these circumstances, email isn't processed, and
accumulates in the inbox. The allocPSA inbox tool exists to allow an
allocPSA super-user administrator to manage this accumulated mail,
manually.


Inbox Table
~~~~~~~~~~~

The allocPSA mail inbox is presented as a table, with a number of data
columns:

.. list-table::

   - - ID
     - The message ID as indicated by the mail server
   - - New
     - Indicates if this is new email, not having been opened yet.
   - - Date
     - Indicates the date the mail was sent.
   - - Email
     - Displays who the mail is from, along with the Subject: line.


Arching, Creating New Tasks and Attaching Emails to Existing Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are also a number of Action buttons, which allow you to perform
actions on each of the emails:

.. list-table::

   - - Archive
     - Clicking on this will cause that mail item to be archived, into
       a separate mail folder.x
   - - New Tasks
     - Clicking on this will extract information from that mail, to turn
       it into a new ticket. The Task ID for the new ticket is provided
       in the informational response, given at the top of the inbox
       page.
   - - Existing Task
     - This will provide a mechanism for you to nominate an existing
       Task ID that this email relates to, along with a choice of which
       group of people should receive this new material by way of a new
       comment email thread (default interested parties, internal
       interested parties or no interested parties.) Once done, pressing
       the Go button will route this message accordingly, attaching it
       to the nominated task in the process.



Tools
-----

The tools tab provide more management tools, additional resources, and useful
customizations. It is a framework wich you can use to add your own
site-specific add-ons.

The Finance section is the gateway to most of allocPSA's finance modules. It
has reasonably complicated functions which most users don't need. In general,
only the user's TF account and Expense Forms are needed by regular/employee
users.

Part of almost any professional services organization is the management of the
finances associated with the Projects and Tasks which constitute the daily
operations of the organization. As a Professional Services Automation system,
allocPSA includes a modular and flexible finance management system whose
purpose is to provide the conduit for any and all financial transactions with
the professional services organization's accounting software. As such, allocPSA
offers the necessary modules to conduct financial transactional activities
within allocPSA (for Time Sheets, for Project-related Expense Forms etc.) as
well as a shadow of many of the financial transactional activities which are
found in standard modern business accounting systems, such as invoicing,
cost-centre and wages management. As with many other aspects of allocPSA,
non-privileged users can only see a simplified view of the Finance section,
while managers and administrative users will get the full offering.

.. NOTE:: A Tagged Fund (TF) is an allocPSA term referring to the per-Project,
          per-group/division or per-staff-member cost-centre which is tracked
          and managed by allocPSA.

Non-privileged users see these items:

 * TF List,

 * New Expense Form,

 * Search Invoices,

 * View Pending Expense Forms,

 * Search Transactions.

Privileged users see the following items:

 * Approve Invoices,

 * Allocate Invoices,

 * New Transaction,

 * Upload Expenses File,

 * New TF,

 * Push Repeating Expenses Through,

 * Upload Wages Files,

 * Reconciliation Report,

 * View Pending Transaction.


Finance
~~~~~~~

New Tagged Fund
```````````````

.. figure:: images/tf_new.png

    You can create new TF cost-centres for Projects, staff or
    for any other purpose.

When new staff or Projects that need a corresponding TF cost-centre are added
to allocPSA, you can create such accounts from this section of the Finance
area. By default, for staff cost-centres, allocPSA uses a standard Payroll ID
based on a product call QuickPayroll, part of the QuickBooks accounting system.
This number needs to be reconfigured for your site's specific requirements and
accounting software. The instructions below generally apply.

#.  Fill in the contents of the form which include TF Name, Quick Payroll
    Employee Number, Quicken Account Name, Comments, and Last Modified by.

#.  Press the 'Save' button to save your work

#.  Click 'Return to TF List' to return to the TF List page.

This new account will have been automatically added to the TF account list.


List of Tagged Funds
````````````````````

allocPSA has the ability to track internal cost-centres (or Tagged Funds, known
within the program as TFs) for expenses and revenues related to Projects, staff
and business units.

If you are a normal user, a TF is your personal cost-centre account. The TF is
the account into which Time Sheet payments are made (credited) and from which
expense items are taken out of (debited) upon reimbursements.

If you are a manager, you may also be shown any TF cost-centres which have been
allocated to you (among possibly other managers users) to manage.


New Transaction
```````````````

.. figure:: images/transaction.png

    Transaction detail view.

This facility allows for the insertion of new ad-hoc transactions into any
Project or staff TF cost-centre account.

Fill in the fields as per the fairly detailed descriptions and then press any
of the various 'Save' buttons. The new transaction will automatically be added
to that specific TF cost-centre account.


Search Transactions
```````````````````

This facility allows you to search through the Transactions recorded in
allocPSA, using a variety of search options.

There are a number of ways to search the transaction database stored within
allocPSA:

#.  Firstly, you can choose the cost-centre TF of any Project or staff member,
    from the drop list.

#.  You can also select the status of the transactions from the drop list.
    Options include All, Pending, Rejected and Approved.

#.  You can supply the period sought through dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.

#.  You can also enter the Transaction ID or Expense Form ID directly.

You can also apply the various search criteria in combinations. allocPSA will
search the database and return a list of matching records.


.. figure:: images/statement.png

    A cost-centre is like an internal bank account. You can review its contents
    much like you would any online bank account.

A user with higher privileges can drill down into the transactions by
clicking on any 'ID' links will show you the Invoice details.

Repeating Expenses can let user create an expense that repeats on a fixed
basis. All that needs to be done to process the next cycle is for the financial
Admin user to press the New button, which creates the repeating transaction.

Privileged users can view all TFs by clicking the 'Edit TF' link associated
with each TF account.


New Expense Form
````````````````

Expense forms are created in allocPSA to better represent the Project
accounting costs associated with each Project. For instance, if more laptops
are needed to meet certain Project deliverables, then the costs for these
laptops should be borne by that Project.

To create a once off expense form, follow the instructions below:

#.  In the allocPSA toolbar, click on the 'Tools', then click 'New Expense
    Form'.

#.  Select your payment options and click the 'Create Expense Form' button.

#.  Add your expense(s) by completing the details. Specify the company name and
    address, and product, the date, unit cost and number of units, etc.

#.  Click 'Add Item' and repeat the previous step if necessary, adding as many
    items, from as many suppliers as needed.

#.  Click the 'To Admin' button when you want to submit this Expense Form.

#.  In general, you may want to print a hardcopy of this form, so you can
    attach expense receipts or Invoices for taxation purposes. You can do this
    by clicking on the 'Printer Friendly Version' in the top right-hand corner.


View Pending Expenses
`````````````````````

This facility allows you to view the Pending Expense Forms allocated to the TF
cost-centre accounts you manage. This information provided includes the expense
form ID, when it was Last Modified, who it was last Modified By, the Payment
Method and Form Total.

#.  Click the ID link you want and go into the detail of the expenses form. You
    will use the same page as New Expense Form.

#.  Follow the instructions and then press the 'Save' button to commit those
    changes.


Upload Wages File
`````````````````

Allows for the uploading of wage transaction files into TF Cost Centres,
normally in Quicken Interchange Format QIF text format, from your accounting
system.

#.  Enter the file name in the space provided, or

#.  Press the 'Browse' button to search the file

#.  Press the 'Upload' button after you have chosen the file

allocPSA will now take a few seconds to upload the file and add the data to the
Project accounting system and will then return to the main 'Finance' page when
finish uploading.


New Repeating Expense
`````````````````````

This will let you create an automated transaction creation. You can specify
the regularity and description and TF etc.


Repeating Expense List
``````````````````````

This is a list of all the Repeating Expenses.


Execute Repeating Expenses
``````````````````````````

Repeating expenses are re-occurring expenses that are created by a scheduled
job that runs once per day. If that job is not run, the repeating expenses may
be manually created by clicking this link.

Click the link to create all repeating expenses that are scheduled to be
created.


Miscellaneous

#.  Click the 'Return to Permission List' link to return to the Permission page.

Your changes will be automatically updated on the Permission page and activated for all users.


Search
``````

The search functionality within allocPSA searches various fields in the
database and also the files in the wiki. It uses the Zend port of the Lucene
search engine.

Any of the keyword fields that are indexed may be searched upon. Either by
itself or in combination with other search terms. The default is to search
across ALL keyword fields.

For more information about the Zend search syntax please read this article:

    against those skill types.

This tool allows you to review, filter and drill down into the various
skillsets of your resource list as known by allocPSA. Whilst the samples
provided and screenshots shown display IT-related skills, this module can be
configured to handle any type of skill set. e.g: Mechanic, Engine Rebuilder,
Panel Beater.

Reports
```````

allocPSA provides an open and flexible way in which you can extract data from
its database. This is managed through the Reports interface.

Reporting allows you to select which tables, fields and criteria you want to
sort and filter data out from your allocPSA database. The data can be displayed
on-screen within the web browser, or bundled into a text-based Comma Separated
Value (CSV) or TAB delimited file, for downloading to your computer. This data
can then be inserted into applications like Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc
(http://www.libreoffice.org/), Crystal Reports, Microsoft Access or other
reporting tools.

#.  Click the 'Reports' link on the 'Tools' page.

#.  Select which module you want to report on (Clients, Tasks etc.)

#.  Press the 'Show Fields' button.

#.  allocPSA will now display all the database table fields which pertain to
    that module.

#.  If you want to pull data out of any particular field, you need to click its
    corresponding checkbox.

#.  If you want to enact any filtering on that field, for instance, in answer to
    the question 'Show me all Clients companies which have names starting with
    the word HyperGlobalMegaNet', you would use the following filter criteria:
    HyperGlobalMegaNet%

#.  Alternatively, you can specify number ranges, upper and lower, using the
    supplied numeric criteria fields.

#.  Scroll down to the bottom and press the 'Generate Database Report' button.

#.  This will now show the resulting records below the fields and selection
    criteria.

#.  You can also elect to put quotes around the field data (handy when dealing
    with data which has commas etc.) by selecting the option from the 'Quotes
    around fields' droplist.

#.  Rather than dumping the resulting dataset to the browser, you can tick the
    'Generate File' checkbox and allocPSA will supply the resulting dataset in
    the form of a text file.

#.  You can also select a number of delimiters, comma (,), TAB (tab),
    double-hash (##) etc., which you can then use to separate your fields when
    you pull them into your report analysis application, or mail-merge
    facility.


Database & File Backup
``````````````````````

allocPSA allows super-users to create database and uploaded file backups, and
then subsequently download, upload or restore a backup file.

#.  Click the 'Database & File Backup' link on the allocPSA Tools tab to go to
    the backup page.

#.  Click the 'Create New Backup' button.

#.  A list of generated backup files will appear, (you can have multiple
    backups).

#.  If you click the link for the backup file, you can download the file to
    your computer.

#.  If you click the 'Restore' button next to a backup file, that backup file
    will be used to overwrite your current allocPSA database and file uploads.
    Be careful with this feature. (A backup will be auto-created before all
    'Restore' operations).

#.  You can choose to clear up some space by removing a backup file by clicking
    the 'Delete' button.

#.  You can download a backup file, unzip it, edit it, zip it back up, and then
    re-upload it using the 'Upload Backup Zip File' button, and then restore that
    newly uploaded backup using the 'Restore' button.

.. NOTE:: Be very careful using this feature. Especially when mixing and
          matching different versions of allocPSA as restoring a backup file
          from an earlier release of allocPSA onto a new release probably isn't
          going to work.

.. NOTE:: Sometimes the PHP memory limit of your webserver will need to be
          increased to allow for large files and databases.
