Product Support Community
===============================

Free, community support for allocPSA is available here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/allocpsa/forums/forum/773745

This is a web forum system where you can join, post your queries and get
responses from the allocPSA user community.

Product Support Commercial
================================

allocPSA is free, open source software. As such, you are free to use it in
any manner you like. This includes:

1. installing and using allocPSA in a commercial environment, in a commercial
   manner,

2. installing and using allocPSA on as many computers or servers as you like,
   and

3. having allocPSA accessed and used by as many users as you like.

If you have the technical skill in-house or can hire them, you may be happy to
support and maintain this product on your own. However, allocPSA was developed
and is commercially supported by Cyber IT Solutions Pty. Ltd., based in Melbourne,
Australia.

Cyber IT Solutions has been providing commercial support since 1991 and has been
the allocPSA product developer and maintainer since 2000. As such, we can offer
your firm high-quality support. In addition, because allocPSA is open source
software, and any other competent web-development firm can also elect to offer
commercial support for it, Cyber IT Solutions must also offer great value in its
support services.

Customisation
-------------

No two services businesses work the same way. To provide for this reality,
allocPSA was designed and is intended to be customised for each site. To that
end, Cyber IT offers your firm a complete customisation service, whereby
allocPSA can be optimised for your work processes, your firm's accounting and
billing practices and the software used to implement these, or any other
site-specific requirements.

If allocPSA does most of what your business needs but could benefit from
specific functionality to make it better integrate with your existing business
systems or processes, speak to us about a free quote to add those features into
allocPSA.

Alternatively, as allocPSA is completely open source, you can elect to make any
modifications in-house, or hire a third-party to make any modifications. You
are fully entitled to select either course of action.

Making Your Own Customisations
------------------------------

As allocPSA is released under an Open Source license, the GNU Affero
General Public License, you are welcome to make your own site-specific
customisations. However, the license requires that you must provide the
capability for your end-users and the people that you re-distribute your
changes to, to access the source code to your modifications as well, thereby
affording them the same freedoms that you have enjoyed. Please note that there
is an "allocPSA Source Code" viewer in the Tools menu.

If you do build extensions onto allocPSA, please consider donating these back
to the allocPSA project. This will provide two benefits:

1. You will be making a contribution back to the community, so that allocPSA
   grows in capabilities and polish, with time.

2. You will reduce your level of burden by feeding your code changes back
   up stream, you will let the project maintainers maintain your modified
   codebase, ensuring that new versions include the features you want and that
   these continue to work with the other new as well as the existing
   features in newer versions of allocPSA.

Integration
-----------

Cyber IT maintains a full integration, support and development team which is
able to assist you in integrating allocPSA into your organisation's information
system architecture.


Online Web Hosting
------------------

Cyber IT Solutions in partnership with  2007-2013 ALSG is now proud to
offer online hosting of the allocPSA application. For more information

Introduction
============

Welcome to the user-level documentation for allocPSA.

allocPSA is an on-line, web-based Professional Services Automation
system. allocPSA provides a suite of integrated applications designed for
organisations which provide services to Clients. It enables services personnel
to become more productive and profitable by increasing their efficiency through
increased utilisation and productive time, improved planning and integrated
knowledge management. It reduces the likelihood of slip-ups and increases the
traceability and manageability of projects, expenses, Tasks and people.

allocPSA can streamline the process of allocating staff resources to key
projects, managing strategic initiatives at a granular level, and can offer a
platform for process collaboration and knowledge reuse to any professional
services business.

allocPSA consists of numerous software modules for business areas such as:
resource planning, project management, time and expenses, fault & issues
tracking, message, announcement, reminder and knowledge management,
collaboration, services supply chain, human resources and staff skilling and
certification, item loans and management of cost-centres. allocPSA offers
integration between the modules, as well as an open architecture and
integration with existing external invoicing, book-keeping and payroll systems.

allocPSA is intended for use in daily organisational operations, such as
client contact, project management, task and resource allocation, skills
tracking, time-sheeting, issues tracking, calendaring, reminders and
escalation, item loans, cost expenses and centres as well as integration with
existing external accounts and billing systems.

allocPSA is made available as a server-based appliance. By deploying an
allocPSA system into your network, all staff can access the application from
any networked computer which has a web browser. Depending on your network
configuration and security policies, staff can also access the allocPSA system
from external computers. Therefore, they can monitor Tasks and submit
Time Sheets from home, or from any Internet-access point around the world.

As a web-based application, users access allocPSA via the standard web-browser
they already have on their PCs. No software needs to be installed on their PCs.
Installation and maintenance of allocPSA is therefore a simple and
straightforward affair. The new server is installed and configured in hours and
all users' PCs are able to access the allocPSA application immediately.

allocPSA is open source software - you are provided with full access to the
complete source code under an open source licence. That means you have
open-ended usage and code modification access rights. This greatly reduces your
business risks in adopting allocPSA as a system element in your core business
operations. The product's source code will always be yours in perpetual code
escrow, at no additional cost.

Deployment
----------

allocPSA is supplied as in a number of 'formats':

1. As a download from http://www.allocpsa.org/ which will need to be installed
   on a web application server.

2. As a paid hosted service available from http://www.allocpsa.com/


Installation and Configuration
==============================

Once you've installed allocPSA, you must login and then change the default
login account password. You can do this by accessing the default account
through the People tab and supplying a new strong account password.

You should also update the allocPSA configuration settings, found by clicking
the 'Setup' link in the top right hand corner of the allocPSA toolbar. You can
get more information about each configuration item, by using the Help
squares to the right of each configuration option.

Update the allocPSA configuration information as soon as you can.


Features & Benefits
===================

Modern businesses are quickly recognizing the need to make intelligent use of
information throughout the organization to better address support issues and
other business problems. allocPSA can help track and manage customer requests,
problems, complaints, Tasks and any other projects that need to be tracked.
Web-based action tracking offers the best and most simple way to gain control
over information, issues and Tasks for a group or department, or throughout an
organization worldwide.

With the increasing business requirement that information management
systems provide substantial and immediate return on investment, allocPSA
is the answer to many of your service-industry information management
concerns.

Among other features, allocPSA provides a comprehensive multilevel,
multi-project planning, scheduling and reporting engine scalable to thousands
of projects. The ability to search for qualified and available resources,
assign Tasks and manage staff with a powerful resource search engine across
single or multiple projects.

allocPSA also offers cost-control management and project graphical and
milestone-enabled Gantt-style bar chart reporting capabilities. This makes
allocPSA a valuable platform for managing the priorities and objectives that
drive your business.

Using proven project management disciplines and processes, allocPSA helps you
optimize resources and manage activities to meet project deadlines and budgets.

allocPSA automatically generates customizable outgoing email alerts to
instantly notify relevant assignees, managers and other people involved with
all aspects of service delivery. Daily email alerts, sent to all resources,
outlines that day's key Tasks and scheduled events, meetings and expectations.

A Task and reminder Calendar is available for all staff on entry into allocPSA,
via the Home page.

A filtering drill-down facility to resource (personnel) availability and
skilling makes it possible to determine which of your staff is suited for
particular Project and Tasks.

allocPSA provides a simple inventory and loans management module, a framework
for producing Project cost-estimators, a graphical chart representation of
historical and current business activity, as well as an open-ended and
customisable report generator which allows you to extract data to a web-page or
CSV file, ready for mail-merges or exporting.

How do I Add an Appointment?
----------------------------

An appointment is actually a Task with an optional reminder. We'll assume that
you have already created a new Task which is a meeting with somebody at a
particular time and place. Then, an appointment is created by the following
steps.

1. Log in to allocPSA

2. Locate and click on the Task that relates to the proposed meeting Task on
   the 'Task Calendar'.

3. It is recommended that the Task name should contain the contact person, the
   time and the place.

4. Click 'New Reminder' located on the 'Reminder' section of the Task

5. Select the Date, Time, Recurring and Advanced notice needed according to
   your requirements of the meeting like location, dress code, the time

6. Press 'Save' button

7. If you now go to the 'Task Calendar' of the 'Home' page again, you should
   find there is a new reminder for that meeting.

HINT: It is a good idea, when creating a meeting Task, to give it a name
which includes information about who/what/when and when. Here's an example:
Meeting with Yvonne Smith (Partek Partners) to discuss support issues. Office,
Tuesday, 10am'

How do I Add a Meeting Reminder?
--------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA

2. From the action Quick List drop list on the allocPSA toolbar, select 'New
   Reminder'

3. Choose the type of the reminder from the drop list. Four types of reminders

   type of reminder is Client, Project, Task. And press 'Next' button

5. Fill in the form

6. Select the Date, Time, Recurring and Advanced notice according to your
   requirement of the meeting like dress code, the time required to arrive

7. Press 'Save' button.

How do I Re-Edit a Task's Name?

   editing. You can follow these steps to make the header accessible again.

2. Log in to allocPSA.

3. From the toolbar, select 'Tasks'.

4. Select the Task you want to edit from the 'Task Summary' Table

5. Click 'Edit' button at the bottom of the screen. (Or just double-click the main Task panel).

6. Edit the name or any other aspect of the Task header.

7. Press 'Save' button at the bottom


How do I Delete a Task?
-----------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. From the toolbar, press 'Tasks'.

3. Select the Task you want to delete from the 'Task Summary' list.

5. Press the 'Edit' button, then press the 'Delete' button.

6. A dialog-box will appear asking you 'Are you sure to delete this record?',
   press 'OK' to confirm the deletion of the Task.

NOTE: It is generally good practice *not* to delete data (like tasks)
from allocPSA. If you want to make it so that a particular task is no
longer 'visible' in day-to-day usage, it is best to edit the task, and
to mark it as being Complete or Pending. You can make this change from
the Status drop-list of the task header.


How do I Create a New Time Sheet?
---------------------------------

NOTE: In order to create a time sheet, you really need to have created a
project and task(s) first.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. From the action 'Quick List' drop list on the allocPSA toolbar, select 'New
   Time Sheet' link.

3. Choose the Project that this Time Sheet belongs to.

4. Press the 'Save' button to continue or 'Delete' to delete this Time Sheet.

5. Time Sheets are made up of individual line items, pertaining to specific
   Tasks. For instance, you may have worked for 3 hours on one problem (Task
   A), 2 hours on Task B and 1 hour on Task C, all for the one Client.

6. For each Time Sheet line item, fill in Date, Duration, Task and Location.

7. Press the 'Add Time Sheet Item' button to add each new line item.

8. Repeat step 7 to add more line item entries if needed.

9. Press 'Time Sheet to Admin' button when done. An email will be sent off to the
   person designated as the next stop in the Time Sheet workflow process.

HINT: You can save the Time Sheet as-is, then return to it later on.

HINT: You can track the progress of your Time Sheets from the 'Time Sheet'
section of your 'Homepage'.

HINT: If you're a manager designated to receive requests to authorise Time
Sheets, you can view them from the 'Time Sheet' section of your 'Homepage'.

How do I Ensure Staff Effort on Tasks is Captured as Time Sheets?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: allocPSA provides managers with the ability to add small comments
(or hints) to specific tasks, to assist them in tracking the work levels
on those tasks by staff. This can be useful in professional services
organisations as a truer representation of work-levels being allocated
to tasks, and thus in helping improve utilisation and this
client-billing. It does obviously mean that managers need to keep
regular tabs on staff activity, such that even if staff don't nominate
work effort on a task (via a time sheet entry), then a manager can make
a note to query the staff member about that effort.

NOTE: In order to make use of this facility, you need to have Manager
privileges and you also need to switch on the New Time Sheet Item Hint
option for your Home page. The New Time Sheet Item Hint feature provides
a text-entry box on the user's Home page. This will allow them to
quickly add indications (or hints) of what work different team members
are doing. To learn how to enable this feature, please refer to `How
do I Customise my Home Page?`_ .

#. Log in to allocPSA

#. Click into the Home page.

#. In the information block titled New Time Sheet Item Hint, enter the
   following items within the textbox:

   #. Username - of the person whome you're adding this time sheet hint
      for.
   #. Duration - in the standard time increments for that user (eg,
      hours).
   #. TaskID - the ID of the task that you want to add this hint for.
   #. Comment - an optional note for your future reference.

   NOTE: As you're typing these details into the textbox, allocPSA will
   being rendering them into a time-sheet hint entry, in the lower part of
   the information block, showing you the details in a fuller-form.
 
#. Once you're satisfied that the information you've entered and had
   presented back to you is correct, press the Enter key. This will cause
   allocPSA to accept the material you've provided, and add it as a hint
   in the corresponding task. 

NOTE: This tool is useful in hinting at (and perhaps capturing) 'time
effort' which is performed by staff, if the staff aren't transacting any
activities through allocPSA for that task. If, however, the staff are
taking actions on the task which allocPSA is capturing, then you can use
another tool to capture any missing time-sheet entries, the Effort
Exception Report. To learn how to enable this feature, please refer to
`How do I Prepare an Un-billed Effort Exception Report?`_ .

How do I Find My Currently Active Timesheets?
---------------------------------------------

#. Log in to allocPSA

#. Click into the Home page.

#. Look in the Current Time Sheets information block. Any time-sheets
   which you can edit are marked as Add Time in Status. Any other
   time-sheets are either with a Manager or with Admin.

#. To open a time-sheet, click on its corresponding Project link.



How do I Make My Time-sheet Editable Again?
-------------------------------------------

NOTE: Once a time-sheet has been submitted by a user, then that user can
no longer edit it. To make it editable again, the user needs to ask the
the appropriate person (time-sheet or project manager, Admin) to send
the time-sheet back.

#. Log in to allocPSA

#. Click into the Home page.

#. Look in the Current Time Sheets information block. Any time-sheets 
   which you can edit are marked as Add Time in Status. Any other 
   time-sheets are either with a Manager or with Admin.

#. To open a time-sheet, click on its corresponding Project link. 
   
#. Once opened, you can use the Comments section of the time-sheet to
   send the appropriate people (time-sheet or project manager, Admin) a
   message, asking for the time-sheet to be sent back. This will then
   re-open the time-sheet for editing by the user. 

NOTE: Some time-sheets have both a Manager who approves the time-sheet,
and Admin, who processes it as part of the workflow. If a time-sheet is
vested with the Admin user(s), then they first need to send the
time-sheet back to the authorising manager, who then sends the
time-sheet back to the user/staff-member. To learn how to send
time-sheets back along the workflow chain, please refer to `How do I
Reject a Time Sheet?`_ .

How do I Authorise a Time Sheet?
--------------------------------

NOTE: You must be setup as a Project Manager + Time Sheet Recipient (on the Project
screen) or be setup as the Time Sheet Admin on the Setup screen in order to
authorise Time Sheets.

1. Log in to allocPSA

2. Click 'admin' or 'manager' on 'Time Sheets Pending Your Approval' table
   which is located on the lower right side of the 'Home' page

3. If you're happy with the information contained on the Time Sheet, press the
   button to submit the Time Sheet to the next step in the workflow.

Alternatively, if an organisation wants a default Time sheet manager,
this is possible to configure via the Time Sheets tab in the Setup
section. Simply edit the Time Sheet Manager to point to the person who
should be the default.

How do I Reject a Time Sheet?
-----------------------------

NOTE: If you've received a message that a specific time-sheet needs to
be rejected (or perhaps even sent back to the previous person on the
time-sheet workflow chain), you can simply find that time-sheet using
allocPSA's standard Search tool. For more information on how to jump to
a time-sheet quickly, please refer to `How do I Quickly Jump to a Time
Sheet if I have the Time Sheet ID?`_ . Once you've found the time-sheet,
you can continue with the appropriate steps in this routine, below.

#. Log in to allocPSA

#. In the Time Sheets Pending Manager information block, you may see a
   list of time-sheets which need your approval.

   NOTE: If you are the Admin user, who processes time-sheets, this
   broad process works also works for you, modulo using the time-sheets
   indicated in the Time Sheets Pending Admin information block.

#. To open each time-sheet in turn, click the Date link associated with
   that time-sheet.

#. If you perceive that there is a problem with the a time-sheet, then add a
   New Comment specifying what the originator should do to fix
   then re-submit the time-sheet, ensuring that you add the appropriate
   user (and yourself) to that comment thread.

#. Once the new comment has been entered, click the Save Comment button.

#. To actually send the time-sheet back, then press the '<- Back' button on the
   Time Sheet (not the web-browser's Back button). Note that this will
   send the time-sheet back to the previous person in the time-sheet
   worflow chain, which may be the time-sheet manager, if you're the
   Admin user. If so, you should be able to click the '<- Back' button
   again, to ensure that the time-sheet reaches the actual original user
   who submitted the time-sheet.

#. An email will be sent to the previous person in the Time Sheet
   workflow, and they can then process the time-sheet accordingly.


How do I Send a Copy of a Time Sheet to Others?
-----------------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA

2. From either the Time Sheet section of your 'Home' page, or from the

part of the text of Client's information.

HINT: If the Client's name begins with a number or other, non-alphabetical
letter, then they will be listed under the 'A' filter list.

HINT: If you're looking at the list of Clients, you can send email to their
primary contact, assuming that one exists and they have an email address listed
in allocPSA, by clicking on their email address as shown in the Client listing
page.

HINT: If you're presently in any particular Client's page, you can send
email to any of the contacts by clicking on their email address (once again,
assuming they have one) as shown in the Client contact page.

How do I Quickly Jump to a Task if I have the Task ID?
------------------------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. If you have a valid task ID (eg, '12762') then you can enter this
   directly into the Quick Search textbox near the top right of the
   allocPSA screen.

3. Entering a number here indicates to allocPSA that you know its a
   Task ID number and that you want to be taken straight to that task.

4. This same approach works for some of the other search items available
   under the Quick Search facility; given a Project or Timesheet ID, you
   can quickly jump to those by selecting the appropriate entity from
   the droplist associated with Quick Search.


How do I Quickly Jump to a Time Sheet if I have the Time Sheet ID?
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. If you have a valid time sheet ID (eg, '12762') then you can enter this
   directly into the Quick Search textbox near the top right of the
   allocPSA screen.

3. Entering a number here indicates to allocPSA that you know its a time
   sheet ID number and that you want to be taken straight to that task.
   
4. This same approach works for some of the other search items available 
   under the Quick Search facility; given a Project or Task ID, you can 
   quickly jump to those by selecting the appropriate entity from 
   the droplist associated with Quick Search.


How do I Add Task/Fault Comments?
---------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Open the Task/Fault you want to add a comment to.

3. Depending on how you last viewed a Task, you may be presented with
   the Task showing a particular tab (eg, Main, Comments or All). To
   show the Comments tab within the task, click on the Comments tab, or
   alternatively, the All tab.

4. You will be presented with the form to add new comments. You can now
   add the comment, select intended recipients, and then click Save
   Comment.

5. If you want to add an additional recipient who doesn't appear on the
   prepared list of recipients, you can add them by click-expanding the
   Email Other Party link, adding their details, and deciding about
   having them added permanently.
   
6. If you want to add an attachment to this Comment, click the Attach
   File link to expand it, then browse to the file you want to attach
   and click the Choose button. You can repeat this process to attach
   more files/documents. Any files you attach will be sent along with
   the email to all the recipients listed with checkboxes, and will
   also be attached to this comment in this Task, for future reference.

7. If your server is set up to receive email and you have configured allocPSA
   correctly you should be able to send emails back and forthe to and from
   clients, using only your regular email client, all the while having the emails
   going through the alloc gateway and being logged to the relevant task or
   fault.

How do I Continue with a Task Comment Conversation Thread?
----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: In order to continue with an existing task comment
discussion/conversation thread, you will have needed to be on that
thread in the first place.

#. Open your email client.

#. You will notice that allocPSA emails have a particular structure in the Subject:
   line, perhaps something like:

   Task Comment: 16713 Investigate Anti-Virus options for Staff server [3. Normal] {Key:cijhkjuq}

#. Assuming you know the Task ID for the comment you want to respond to,
   thus continuing the discussion thread, find an email which relates to
   that task.

#. Use your email client's standard Reply to reply to that task.
   **NOTE:** you do not need to do a Reply-all or Group-reply, as
   replying through the allocPSA email gateway will ensure that all the
   people on that conversation thread will be automatically sent a copy of
   your response. 

#. If you want to reply to a specific conversation thread, as
   represented by a Key, for example {Key:cijhkjuq} from above, use that
   key as your search criterion in your email client, rather than just the
   Task ID.

How do I Establish a Default Interested Paries List for a Project's Tasks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: allocPSA has a concept of Interested Parties; namely, people both
within and external to your organisation who may be involved in work and
responses on tasks. For each task you create, you can nominate who
should be added to any conversation threads that originate on that task,
by default. Obviously, this list can be hand-tweaked for not only each
task, but also for each separate new discussion thread on that task. For
more information on Interested Parties and discussion threads, please
refer to `How do I Add Task/Fault Comments?`_ .

#. Log in to allocPSA.

#. If you're creating a new project and want to add a default Interested
   Parties list for it, please refer to `How do I Create a New
   Project?`_ first, then continue here. 

#. If you already have an existing project, open it.

#. Once you're on the project's main page, click the Edit Project
   button. This will open the project's header for editing.

#. The Default Interested Parties drop-list should show you the various
   people, internal and external, associated with this project. If you
   click the drop-list, it will reveal the list, from which you can
   click-toggle the people you want as members of any tasks's default
   Intersted Parties.

#. Once you've established who should be on each new project task's
   Interested Parties list, you can click the project header's Save button.

How do I Establish Default Rates for People?
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: This function assume that your organisation sets default rates for
some or all staff. 

#. Log in to allocPSA.

#. Click into the People tab.

#. From the list present, open the page for the staff member you want to
   set a default rate for.

#. In the Default Rate field, enter the rate and then select the
   duration (hourly, daily, weekly, etc) from the drop-list.   

#. Click the Person Details header Save button.

NOTE: When you next add this person to a project, their rate and
duration will be entered automatically.


How do I Bookmark Task List Filters for Future Use?
---------------------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Click on the Tasks tab to bring up the Task List.

3. Change the filter settings to reflect what you want to show in the
   list. You can select which projects you want to show the tasks for,
   which project resources; open or closed tasks; which fields you want
   displayed, etc.

4. When done, apply the Filter.

5. You will be shown the resulting filtered Task List.

6. If you want to view the updated list with the same filters applied in
   future. you can now Bookmark this page, using your web-browsers standard
   bookmarking functionality.

7. To bring up the Filter in future, merely access the stored Bookmark,
   and allocPSA will provide a refreshed view of the same Task List filter.


How do I Mark a Task as Pending?
--------------------------------

Note: Under some circumstances, there may be value in marking some tasks
in such a way that they don't appear in the nornal, day-to-day views,
but are still available just on the periphery. This might occur when
where you're waiting on information, or waiting on customer approval or
feedback. allocPSA provides a convenient way to manage such 'paused'
tasks, through the Pending attribute.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as
   Pending.

3. From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
   will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
   Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.

4. Select the Pending option from the Status droplist. For example,
   Pending: Info, which means that the task is in limbo while specific
   information is sought, or Pending: Manager, which means that the task
   awaiting the go-ahead from an allocPSA manager, or Pending: Client,
   which means that the task is awaiting information or the go-ahead
   from the Client associated with the task.

5. Once the Pending option has been selected, Save the task.

6. You can, at any point, change the Status back to Open: or any other
   setting using the approach outlined above.

Note: You will note that a task which has had its Status changed from Open: to
Pending: may now not be included in the Task List filter or the Home
Page filter, if these have been established to show only Open: tasks.

Note: If a user selects to show only Open and not Open and Pending tasks
in their allocPSA 'home' page, then tasks marked Pending will not appear
in the 'home' page task list.


How do I Close a Task?
----------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as
   Closed.

3. From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
   will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
   Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.

4. Select one of the Closed options from the Status droplist. For example,
   Closed: Invalid, which means that the task was incorrectly added to
   allocPSA, or Closed: Duplicate, which means that the task is a
   duplicate of another, existing task, or Closed: Incomplete, which means
   that the task could not be completed, or the issue resolved, or
   Closed: Completed, which means that task was completed or the
   fault/issue resolved.

5. Once the Closed option has been selected, Save the task.

6. You can, at any point, change the Status back to Open: or any other
   setting using the approach outlined above.

You will note that if you mark the task Closed: Duplicate, then you will
be prompted for the Task ID of the task which it's a duplicate of, for
record-keeping purposes. This is covered in detail elsewhere in this
documentation. allocPSA allows for one and only one 'duplicate' task to
be linked to.

You will also note that once you close a task, the Actual Completion
date will be set to today's date.


How do I Make (Attribute) Changes to Many Tasks at Once?
--------------------------------------------------------

Note: While you are able to make changes to attributes (eg, Task
Assignee, Task Priority, Completion Date etc.) on a per-task basis,
allocPSA offers you a mechanism by which you can change these properties
across many tasks at once.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Go to the Tasks tab, and list the tasks you are interested in making
   changes to. This may be a soper-set of the actual tasks you want to
   change, for example, all Open tasks, or all tasks assigned to a
   particular person for a select group of projects.

3. Using the 'checkboxes' running along the left edge of the task list,
   select the tasks you're interested in changing an attribute for.

4. Once you've selected all the pertinent tasks, select the *type* of
   attribute change action you want to make. Examples include:

   - Assign to:
   - Manager to:
   - Time Limit to:
   - Task Priority to:
   - Task Type to:
   - Target Start Date to:
   - Target Completion Date to:
   - Actual Start Date to:
   - Actual Completion Date to:
   - Project and Parent Task to:

5. For each of these attribute change actions, you will be given a
   custom data entry field or pick list, from which you can select the
   new attribute value to set for your list of selected tasks.

6. Once you've set the new attribute value for the group, click the
   Update Tasks button, to make the actual change across your list of
   selected tasks.

7. If you more than one attribute change to make across this list of
   tasks, follow the above steps, and change additional attributes.


How do I Mark a Task as a Duplicate?
------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Open the task (fault, message) that you would like to mark as
   as a duplicate.

3. From the Main (or All) task tab, click the Edit Task button. This
   will open the task header section for editing. By default, a task is
   Open: Not Started, until work has begun on a task.

4. Select the Closed: Duplicate option from the Status droplist.

5. This will show a textbox beside the Status droplist, into which you
   sould enter the Task ID of the the task which it's a duplicate of,
   for record-keeping purposes. allocPSA allows for one and only one
   'duplicate' task to be linked to.

6. Save the task.


How do I use the allocPSA Email Gateway?
----------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Ensure allocPSA and your webserver is configured to send and receive emails. (Setup -> Email screen)

3. Create a task, or open an existing task.

4. Create a comment and select which recipients you would like to receive your comment.

5. Hit the Save Comment button. Note that if you want to receive the
   replies to that comment you will need to select your own name from the list of
   recipients.

6. You can also use certain keywords in your reply to access additional functionality via email.

   The allocPSA task email subject lines currently look something like this:

   [allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd}

   When composing an email reply via your regular email client, you may
   append certain keywords *after* the {Key:fdsfds} bit. The keywords are not
   case-sensitive and can be in any order. You can use one-or-many of:

   * sub subscribe
   * unsub unsubscribe
   * close pending open
   * notstarted inprogress info manager client invalid duplicate:1234 incomplete complete
   * quiet
   * 3.25 (i.e. a number, to two decimal places)

   Sub/Subscribe adds you to that alloc task conversation. Unsub/unsubscribe
   removes you from that conversation. Some text will be prepended to the
   comment saying what has happened eg: "Jonny Apple has been added to this 
   conversation".

   Close closes the associated task. Open opens the task. And Pending makes the
   task status pending. The Actual Completion date is filled or unfilled and the
   Task Status moves to Closed:Completed or Open:In progress or Pending:Info. 
   The action is logged on the Task History tab.

   If you want to exert finer control over the Task Status, you may use one of
   the specific Task Sub-Status keywords: notstarted, inprogress, info,
   manager, client, invalid, duplicate, incomplete or complete. If the task is to
   be a duplicate, specify the duplicate task ID after a colon eg: duplicate:1234

   Quiet means do not re-send this email. Previously only unsubscription
   requests would *not* get re-sent. Now they *do* get re-emailed. You can
   quell them with this "quiet" keyword. Likewise if you just want to add a
   comment to the conversation thread without re-emailing everyone, quiet is
   what you want.

   A number. This number represents a time duration for a time sheet. This
   way you can add time to a time sheet via email. If no time sheet exists,
   one is automatically created. If you are not on the project, the time sheet
   is still created and the time sheet item entry is still added, however your
   rate will be set to zero, and you will have to fix it manually.
   Additionally some text will be prepended to the top of the comment which
   says eg "Danielle Johnston has added 2.00 Hours to time sheet #34232." and/or
   "Danielle Johnston has not been added to project #22".  The body of the email is
   added as the time sheet item comment. So it is best to keep the email
   short. It probably makes sense to add the quiet keyword when adding time.

   So if you reply to alloc with an email that has a subject line like this:

   [allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd} 3.25 quiet close

   then:

   * 3.25 (hours/days/or whatever is specified at the project level) are added to your time sheet.
   * No email is re-sent to people.
   * The task is closed.

   or eg this:

   [allocPSA] 12321 Task name goes here {Key:fds432fd} open unsub 10

   then:

   * Task is re-opened (if it was closed).
   * You are removed from that task conversation.
   * 10 hours/days/etc are added to your time sheet for that task.

   The system uses your From address to identify you. If you don't use a
   from address that is recognized by alloc then your commands are mostly
   ignored. However if the {Key:} is correct the comment will
   still be added. So for example if a client sticks random numbers in the
   subject line, it's not going to randomly create time sheets, but the
   comment will still come across.

   Everything up to the {Key:sfdsffs} is actually ignored, so the email could just look
   like this:

   To: alloc@somewhere.com.au
   From: ben@otherplace.com.au
   Subject: {Key:fds432fd} close 3

   All emails that alloc receives are stored and are available for
   download (if need be) from the UI same as usual, headers intact. Ideally
   you are also storing your sent-mail which should make reconciliation a
   little easier. alloc also stores a new field on the back-end that tracks
   which emails are responsible for which time sheet items.

How do I Monitor Tagged-Funds/Cost-Centres That I'm Interested In?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: allocPSA supports cost-centres (also-known-as tagged-funds) for
projects and staff. These allow for the tracking and movement of monies
within an organisation and amongst an organisation's project and staff
'boundaries'. tagged-funds are used to determine and track expenses,
time sheets, etc. Some people, particularly Admin and Manager users, may
need to track many such tagged-funds at once. As such, thay may find it
useful to have those particular tagged-funds display their current
account balance on the 'home' page. To make this happen, follow these
steps.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Go to the Tools tab of the main menu.

3. From the Finance list, click the List of Tagged Funds link. The
   Tagged Funds list will appear, but it make take a while, as allocPSA
   has to perform quite a few calculations.

4. If the list is too long, you can expand the Filter to allow you to
   drill-down into the tagged funds you're interested in. To do so,
   click the Show Filter link, near the top right.

5. When you find the tagged fund that you want to add an account-balance
   view of in your 'home' page, click the Edit TF link, at the right of
   the selected tagged fund.

6. Once inside the tagged fund, you will notice that it offers you a
   drop-list to your name as one of the tagged fund owners, in the
   TF owners section of the page. Once you've selected your name from
   the list, click the Add button.

7. You can now check that this additional tagged-fund/cost-centre is
   visible to you from your 'home' page, by clicking on the Home tab of
   the main menu, and checking that the new tagged fund account balance
   is being displayed in the Tagged Funds content block near the top
   right.


How do I Quickly Jump Back to a Recent Task/Project/Timesheet Page?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

More often than not, you'll need to quickly jump back to a recently
opened/created/modified data entity (task, project, timesheet, etc).
allocPSA allows a speedy way to achieve this action.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Open a task, timesheet, project or other mainstream data entity page.

3. For the purposes of demonstration, you don't need to make any changes
   to this data entity, but you can if you want to.

4. Now, open another task, timesheet, project or other mainstream data
   entity page.

5. You can do this a few more times, building up a small list of
   recently visited data entities.

6. You can now jump quickly back to each of these, by selected them from
   the QuickList drop-list, near the top-right of the allocPSA screen.
   The list of recently-visited data entities will appear just below the
   group of New <Entity> options, shown at the top of the list.


How do I Customise my Home Page?
--------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Click on the People tab from the main menu.

3. Click on your name from the list of names presented. This will open
   up you Person Details personal settings page.

4. On the right of the Person Details page, you will see the Preferences
   section; Click the Edit button within this section.

5. Change the settings for Font size, Theme, Top Tasks etc.

   - Font size will alter the default font allocPSA uses

   - Theme will alter the colours (look and feel) of allocPSA

   - Top tasks will alter how many tasks are shown in your Home page.

   - Status allows you to select which tasks are shown on your Home
     page, based on their status, It is possible to do
     multiple-selections, for example, all Open and all Pending tasks.

   - Calendar weeks allows you to specify how many weeks forward are
     displayed on your Home page calender.

   - Daily email is deprecated in use, but used-to send out a daily
     summary of tasks to the user.

   - Receive my comments (Self Mail) allows the user to specify of they are sent
     their own comments, as part of a task comment discussion thread.

   - Project list specifies how many projects that the user is assigned
     to, are to be shown on the Home page.

   - Show Filters allows the user to specify if the various list filters
     are shown by default when the user goes to those lists. Examples
     are the Client, Project, Time & Task filters.

     page which presents details about the number of hours worked
     yesterday and today, the last two weeks and the two-week average
     over all time.

   - New Time Sheet Item will make a text-entry box available on the
     user's Home page, which will allow them to quickly add time-sheet
     entries straight from the Home page, rather than having to do so from
     the actual time-sheet.

   - Enabling Private Mode ensures that any sensitive (i.e, financial)
     information which is normally visible on the user's Home page, is
     now obfsucated, made visible obly by moving the mouse over those fields.
  
   - New Time Sheet Item Hint will make a text-entry box available on
     a manager-level user's Home page, which will allow them to quickly add
     indications (or hints) of what work different teams members are

How do I Hide any Sensitive Financial Data in my Home Page?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of pages in allocPSA which display financial data.
Most of these relate to work arranged by managers or admin staff, and
are accessed infrequently or under specific circumstances. There is also
potentially sensitive financial data on each user's Home page. allocPSA
therefore provides a method to obfuscate this sensitive data, if the
user deems that necessary. To instantiate this obfuscation, the user
needs to:

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Click on the People tab from the main menu.

3. Click on your name from the list of names presented. This will open
   up you Person Details personal settings page.

4. On the right of the Person Details page, you will see the Preferences
   section; Click the Edit button within this section.

5. Switch on the private mode by selecting Yes in the Private Mode
   drop-list. This  ensures that any sensitive (i.e, financial)
   information which is normally visible on the user's Home page, is
   now obfsucated, made visible obly by moving the mouse over those
   fields.

6. Once you've made the changes you need to make, click the Save button
   that relates to this Preferences section. If you've made changes you
   dont want to keep, click the Canceli Edit button.

How do I Sort Tables of Data?
-----------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Bring up and of the mainstream data entity tables, such as the list
   of tasks in the Home page, the list of clients in the Clients tab
   page, the list of projects in the Projects tab page, Time, Invoices
   etc.

3. You will notice that if you hover your mouse pointer over the table
   column headings, for instance, the ID table column heading on the
   Tasks table, that a small up-down-arrow icon will appear. This is
   there to tell you that you can click this table column heading text,
   and allocPSA will sort the data in the table using this column as the
   sorting criterion.

4. Click the same table column heading text again, and the sort order
   will be reversed.

5. Click on another table column heading text, for instance, TASK on the
   Tasks table, and allocPSA will sort the data in the table using this
   column as the sorting criterion.

How do I Bookmark Clients, Tasks, Projects, etc?
------------------------------------------------

allocPSA gives you the ability to add specific records (such as Tasks,
Clients, Projects, Timesheets, Sales and Invoices) to the Star list.
These can then be accessed in a collective 'bookmarks' page, by clicking
the 'star' icon tool, located in the top right section of the main menu,
near the Help, Setup and Logout links.

To add new Star list bookmaks:

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Go to the specific data item that is of interest, for example a Task,
   or a Client record. Alternatively, click into the Clients, Tasks,
   Projects, Time, Invoices or Sales tab, to display the corresponding
   list for that type.
  
3. If on a specific record, for example a single Task, you will notice a
   small 'star' icon, near the top right of that item's menu. Click on
   that small 'star' icon. This will fill the icon with a solid colour.
   This indicates that this record is now in your Star list of
   bookmarks. If you click that filled-in 'star' icon once more, it will
   toggle-off the bookmark. 

4. If you're looking a list of Tasks for instance, you will see a list
   of 'star' icons along the right edge of the table. Clicking on any of
   these will toggle the 'stars' on (filled) or off (empty),
   corresponding to that item being in or out of your Star bookmark list.    

5. To view your Star list of bookmarks, click on the main 'filled in'
   star icon, near the top right of your main screen's menu items.

6. This will open the Star list, showing you all your various bookmarks
   for the different types of items that you've bookmarked. 

7. To remove an item from your Star bookmark list, click (that is,
   uncheck) the 'filled in' star associated with that item (on the far
   right of that item's entry in the table). This will toggle-off the
   bookmark. If you refresh the page, or click on the Star list icon (near
   the top right of your main screen's menu items) again, the item you
   had unchecked should no longer be present. You're always welcome to
   find that item again, and add it to your Star list of bookmarks.

   The time-sheet entries are marked in **Bold**.

6. If you find that there is unbilled work, then you can Click back into the Main task tab, and then click the Time Sheet link near
   the top-right side of this page. Now you can add an appropriately dated time-sheet item to an existing time-sheet, or create a new
   time-sheet and do the same.

Note: You can 'expand' any of these task comments by clicking on them. This will help you establish the context of the actions taken,
and to help determine if this is indeed work that needed to be billed.


How do I Sort Task Comments by Date Order?
------------------------------------------

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Open the task you're interested in.

7. Select the Start Date for this report.

8. Select the End Date for this report.

9. Select the Task Status, for the types of task you want to check the un-billed effort on. It's often best to leave this 'blank'.

10. For a full-overview of the actions taken and their context, you can also check the 'Include Client Comments' check-box,
    but this isn't often needed.

11. Click the Filter button. You will now be presented with a list of tasks, which that person (or people) took actions on, along with
    any corresponding time-sheet entries. This list is grouped per-task, sorted on date.

12. You can 'expand' any of these task comments by clicking on them. This will help you establish the context of the actions taken,
    and to help determine if this is indeed work that needed to be billed.

13. Review the summary items, checking to see if you've done work on this task, for which there isn't a corresponding time-sheet entry.
    The time-sheet entries are marked in **Bold**. A good rule-of-thumb is, if you see task comment entries, with no **bold** time-sheet
    line beneath them, this is possible an item of worked which hasn't been time-sheeted.

14. If you determine that a user has under billed for work performed, you can right-mouse button click on the related task link, or
    otherwise cause it to be opened in a new browser tab, go to the Comments tab, and add a new entry, including appropriate
    internal/external parties (specifically the user who under billed) and alert them to this possibility.

15. They can then review this, and remedy the situation by submitting a new time-sheet entry for this under (or non-) billed work.

How do I Check to Ensure Users are Submitting Their Time-sheets in a Timely Manner?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This process assumes that your organisation has a policy which
outlines that time-sheets should be submitted to time-sheet managers, in
a timely manner. One example would be that time-sheets should be no
older than 7 days.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. Click on to the Time tab.

3. Click the Show Filter link, to reveal the filter tool.

4. If you want to check a particular user's time-sheet, select that user, otherwise leave the User Name drop-list blank.

How do I Manage Support and Help Desk Tasks
-------------------------------------------

**Note**: Some help-desk systems call suppprt tasks 'tickets'. In this
documentation, tickets and tasks can be used inter-changeably.  While there are
no functional differences between tasks assigned in 'help-desk' type projects
or tasks assigned to more traditional 'life-cycle' projects, these are
sometimes managed differently, or by different people within an organisation.
Help-desk tasks/tickets are generally created and managed on an ad-hoc and
on-going basis, and help-desk tasks are oft-times managed by more than one
person within an organisation. The nature of the processes used to manage such
tasks is therefore related to these attributes.

1. Log in to allocPSA.

2. As a help-desk manager, you are likely to want to manage all, or some
   portion of the currently active open support tickets. You can best do this by
   going to the Task tab.

3. Within the Task list page, click on the Show Filter link, along the
   top-right of the page.

4. Within this filter, click the Projects link, situated just above the list of
   projects. This will expand the different categories of Projects.

5. From this list, click the Current option. This will then show you all the
   current, active, open projects.

6. To display all the relevant tasks, either select *all* of the projects
   listed, or de-select them all, so that none are high-lighted in the list.

7. To see the currently active tasks, select Open from the Task Status drop-list.

8. To view the fault tasks/tickets, select Fault from the Task Type list.

9. If you want to further filter down into particular task attributes, you can
   choose these from the Created By, Managed By and Assigned To drop-lists. If you
   don't have requirements for further filtering, leave these blank.

10. You can now select to see a variety of fields on the list of tasks to be filtered. For instance, if you want to see all the details of each task, you can check the Desc & Comments. The following gives you more information about each of these options:

- Desc & Comments: This will show you the description of each task listed, along with all the comments. **Note** Use this option carefully, as the volume of data may be substantial. In general, unless you know there are only a few tasks in the returned task list, don't check this checkbox. 

- Task Dates: This gives you additional information on each task's Target Start, Target Completion,  Actual Start, Actual Completion and Task Created dates.

- Task Creator: This will display the name of the user who created each task

- Task Manager: This will display the name of the user who is set up on the task as the task manager.

- Est, Act & Percent: This will display information on the task's time
  Estimate, the Actual time time-sheeted thus far, and the overall percentage
  of the time time-sheeted versus the estimate. *If* the amount of time
  time-sheeted for this task is more than the time estimated, then the percentage
  will be displayed in **red**.

- Assigned To:  This will display the name of the user who this task is assigned to.

- Priority Info: This will display each task's Project and Task priority, along
  with an overall computed Priority, based on the age of the task, attributed
  priorities, etc.

- Date Status: This will display a computed date estimate to complete the task,
  based on effort and time spent thus far. A typical output would be something
  like 'Started 2010-06-30, forecast completion date of 2010-12-06'.

11. You can also select to filter based on Task Date attributes, by selecting items from the Task Date droplist. Options include:

- New Tasks:

- Due Today:

- Overdue:

- Date Created and then supply a data range on which to filter:

- Date Assigned and then supply a data range on which to filter:

- Estimated Start and then supply a data range on which to filter:

- Estimated Completion and then supply a data range on which to filter:

- Date Started and then supply a data range on which to filter:

- Date Completed and then supply a data range on which to filter:

12. Once all the filter options have been selected, click the Filter button.
    This will generate the list of tasks which match your filter criteria and
    display the information on those tasks, based on your output options.

13. The resulting table can be sorted on particular columns, for instance, task
    ID or task Priority, in the usual manner, by clicking on the column header.
    Click twice to reverse the sort order.

14. You can 'drill-down' into specific tasks, by clicking on their corresponding task name.

15. Using this Tasks page, you can filter and sort the tasks and faults which
    are of interest to you, keeping tabs on when they're due, how they're
    progressing, how much time is being time-sheeted against them, where there are
    time-effort over-runs, etc.


How do I Manage Project Tasks
-----------------------------

Managing project tasks is essentially a similar exercise to managint
Help Desk tasks.

**Note**: While there are no functional differences between tasks assigned in
'help desk' type projects or tasks assigned to more traditional 'life-cycle'
projects, these are sometimes managed differently, or by different people
within an organisation. Life-cycle projects generally have a beginning and
middle and an end, and in general, are managed by a single project manager. The
nature of the processes used to manage such tasks is therefore related to these
attributes


How do I Modify a Task's Interested Parties List for an Existing Comment Thread?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Work your way through this list, checking and un-checking the people
   you want to include or remove from the thread.

8. Once done, click outside of the list-box; the list-box will 'collapse'
   and your changes will be saved.


How does a Task Re-Open Automatically on New Activity?
------------------------------------------------------

If you've placed a Task in Pending or Closed, that task will be
re-activated if an email is received by the email gateway, from one of
the potential *external* Interested Parties (as defined by the list of
email addresses in the Interested Parties list on the main page of that
Task. Email from an *internal* address will not trigger this
state-change.

Useful Tips for using allocPSA
==============================

Firstly, remember that allocPSA is a web-based application. As such, all the
normal behaviour that you would expect from a web-browser functions correctly
in allocPSA. Therefore:

1. When you are viewing a page which is larger than the web-browser window, you
   can always scroll down (and up) with the scrollbar or Page Up or Page Down
   on your keyboard.

2. You can print a whole (or part) page to any printer your workstation has
   been configured to use, at any time, just like you would print a web-page.
   If you see a "Print" link at the top of the screen that indicates that that
   particular pages have been optimised for printing.

3. You can find any piece of text in a page by using your browser's page Find
   function (often a Ctrl + F keystroke or available from the Edit menu)

4. You can save the complete contents of a page to a file, for later review, by
   using your browser's Save Page As... function (often a Ctrl + S keystroke or
   available from the Edit menu)

5. You can trace your steps back to any specific point that you have been
   during this session, by using your browser's Back button (or function, often
   accessed via a Ctrl + Left Keyboard Arrow)

6. You can establish specific browser Bookmarks for particular, commonly used
   Projects, Tasks or function pages in allocPSA

7. You can (with some care) send others within your organisation the current
   web-browser address (i.e. URL) of a particularly interesting page in
   allocPSA that you want them to see.

8. Your organisation can make some parts of allocPSA available to outsiders,
   via an extranet system, which may help them better understand how their
   Project with your firm is progressing.

9. You can Bookmark pages in your web-browser. For example, if you
   establish a specific filter, with options, for showing Tasks,
   bookmark it, and recall the same filter settings on future occasions.

10. **Note** It is a good idea to bookmark at least allocPSA one page in your
    web-browser, and this should be your regular, 'safe' and 'sane' view of tasks,
    perhaps the list of currently open Faults or active and open Tasks, with
    minimal output fields selected. The main reason to create such a book mark is
    that if, by some chance, you select to display a very large result set, by
    selecting perhaps too much output, or too liberal a filter, there could be a
    huge volume of data returned. In some web-server <-> web-browser combinations,
    this might cause timeouts. If you do find yourself in such a scenario, you can
    use your 'sane' bookmark, to 'reset' the task filter into something manageable.

A Note on Dates in allocPSA
---------------------------

As this system is intended for use in multiple countries, it has been designed
to work with International Standards Organisation (ISO) standard dates, which
are in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. Thus the 1st of November, 2002 is displayed as
2002-11-01.

A note on viewing levels and privileges
---------------------------------------

allocPSA has a strict notion of what functions are visible and permissible to
various user levels. While this manual describes all functions which are
available, some (or many) may not be visible to users who do not have the
appropriate access privileges.


allocPSA Tab Menu
=================

The tab menu in allocPSA is at the top of every page of the application. It
is perhaps the most often used component of the allocPSA application. From this
tab bar, you will be able to jump directly to almost all of the main
application modules (Home, Projects, Clients, Tasks, Finances, etc.) There is
also a search facility with which you will be able to look for almost all
important data-sets archived in allocPSA. Finally, there is also an Quick List,
from which, you will be able to create new Tasks, Project, Client entries, as
well as see a list of recently visited pages of the allocPSA application.


Home
----

The Home page is a convenient one-stop spot for you to determine the status of
your Tasks, calendar, cost-centre(s), pending work items, messages, Time Sheets
and any organisation-wide announcements that have been made. For really simple
usage, can operate much of allocPSA from the main screen; many of the other
top-level screens are often function-specific enhancements of the Home screen.

Top Tasks
~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/top_tasks.png

   The highest priority Tasks are arranged according to their urgency by a formula

This section shows you view the top five Tasks which have been allocated to
you. allocPSA uses a weighted formula to determine which of your Tasks should
ranked at the top, based on the Task, phase and Project priority, percentage
complete, target completion etc.

The Tasks should be listed with the Task title (or name), the Project that the
Task belongs to, and the completion status (for example overdue for
completion). Click the Task title (or name) and you will be taken to the
content of that Task.


Calendar
~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/calendar.png

   The calendar show the Tasks, reminders and absences

The Calendar will show you a date-centric view of the current week, fortnight,
month etc. Tasks which are due to begin or finish which fall on specific days,
will be shown in here, as well as any Reminders which have been set up or
Absences which are scheduled.

You can view the details of any single Task by clicking on that Task. You can
modify the the date-range shown within the calendar by clicking on the single
or multi-week options shown. Only your Tasks are shown in the calendar. As with
all other parts of allocPSA, you can print this page, including your full
calendar, to any printer configured on your workstation. You can create new
Tasks, reminders or absences by clicking on any of the three icons that are in
the top-left hand corner of each day in the calendar.

Project List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/project_list.png

   The table above listed all the new Projects belonging to their corresponding Clients

allocPSA allows for the management of Projects, among other things. Within your
Home page, allocPSA shows Projects which are allocated to you, the user. The
list shows you the Client that the Project belongs to, which can be an internal
Client, within your organisation, or an external Client.

The Project name, which you can click on to jump to that particular Project, a
link to the list of Tasks for that particular Project, as well as link to the
Task Graph, for a that Project.

For more information, please refer to the 'Project' section.


Cost Centres & TF (Tagged Fund)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA uses the concept of Cost Centres (called Tagged Funds or just TFs) to
show the maintain and track the financial state of each Project's or Person's
accounts.

As a Professional Services Automation system, allocPSA must keep track of both
the expenses and revenues of a Project as well as cost-centres for individual
consultants and resources. It does so with a form of cost centre called a
tagged fund (TF for short). In this home page view, a user will be shown
their own personal cost centre account balance, as well as the present balance
of any Projects they have been allocated to oversee financially.

Click the account name you want to view in greater detail, and you will be
taken to that account. The account information page is described in detail
elsewhere in this document, but suffice to say that it displays and behaves
very much like an online bank account statement, with money being debited and
credited for any number of other accounts and source, reflecting the generation
and processing of Time Sheets, billable hours, Expense Forms and financial
injections from external systems like invoicing etc.

Current Time Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA allows users to submit Time Sheets allocated to specific Projects or
consultancy jobs. The list of Time Sheets shown in the Home page is the list of
Time Sheets which are presently still being edited or worked on by the user. In
other words, they are in progress.

Click the link of the Time Sheet status to enter into the current
Time Sheet.

Customize Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The appearance and font-size of allocPSA can be changed to suit the user's taste.
Additionally the Top Tasks, Calendar and Project List on the home page can be
customized to individual preference.

The list of items which can be configured on a per-user basis includes:

.. list-table::

  - - Setting
    - What it affects
  - - Font Size
    - the size of the standard font to use. 
  - - Theme 
    - the visual theme the user prefers.
  - - Top tasks 
    - the number of the user's tasks to show in the Home page.
  - - Status 
    - used to nominate which tasks (selected by status) the user
      wants displayed in their Home page.
  - - Calendar Weeks 
    - the number of (forward) weeks displayed in the Calendar.
  - - Weeks Back 
    - the number of preceding weeks displayed in the Calendar.
  - - Project List 
    - the number of the user's projects to show in the Home page.
  - - Show Filters 
    - on pages which have filters, shows the 'filter' section of the form by default when you go to pages with a filter, e.g. the
      task list, etc.

Settings can be changed by making a selection from the respective
drop-lists. When satisfied, press the 'Save' button to confirm the changes.


Clients
-------

.. figure:: images/client_list.png

   List(s) of current, potential and archived Clients are
   shown in the Clients section of allocPSA

All Professional Services Organisations (PSO) have a notion of Clients. This
normally includes all main companies and organisations that the PSO has contact
with. allocPSA has the ability to track all current, potential and archived
(i.e. lapsed) Clients. Besides the core organisational information, any number
of contacts can also be entered for each organisation tracked. The information
maintained includes the Client Name, Contact Name, Contact Phone, Contact
E-mail etc.

allocPSA also allows for the attachment of documents which pertain to this
Client, as well as any per-Client reminders that need to be added.

To view the list of current Clients, you need to click on the 'Clients'
tab in the allocPSA main menu. You will then be taken to the Clients tab
page, where you will be shown a table of current Clients.

You can filter the list of clients shown in the Clients tab page, by
clicking the Show Filter link, if this is presented, which will open up
the filter segment of the page. Using this filter, you can select
portions of a client name or a contact name within a client
organisation, which you want to filter on, along with the client's
Status (Current, Potential, Archived) and the client's Category (Client,
Vendor, Supplier, Non-profit, etc).

Once you have selected the filter criteria, you click the Filter button,
and allocPSA will show you the matching entries. You can remove a
filter, by clearing out the values in the filter text boxes, and
clicking the Filter button once more.

You can also using the alphabetic quick-links shown at the bottom of the
filter segment, to show all the client organisations which start with
A, B, C etc.

You can view and edit details for each Client, by clicking on that
client's link.

Hint: When allocPSA lists the list of current Client's, you can use your
browser's Find facility (often a Ctrl + F keystroke or available from the Edit
menu) to find any piece of text in this page. Thus, if you know that the
surname of the contact that you want is Purcell, you can quickly locate this
contact and jump straight to that contact's details on this Client list page.

If you want to view the list of Potential Clients, you can change the drop-list
which specifies Client type, and press the 'Filter' button. The same process
can be used to list All or Archived Clients.

Hint: If you have nominated a primary contacts for a Client, then that primary
contact's details will be shown in the Client listing. If those details include
an email address, that email address will be hyperlinked, so that you can click
on it to send that person mail, straight from within your mail Client.  You
will note that much like Task and Project forms, the Client forms have a header
component, as well as the body or main component. The header is used to store
information for the company or organisation which is common to all of the
contacts, such as headquarters address details, main switch and fax number.

.. figure:: images/client.png

   Each Client record is defined as a Client organisation
   detail header and any number of contacts, reminders, documents, comments
   etc.

.. figure:: images/client_contact.png

   For each Client you can have as many contacts as you liked. Just click the
   "New+" link in the top right hand corner of the Client Contact box, fill in
   the details and then click the "Save Client Contact" button.
   You can designate one Client Contact to be the Primary, which will make it then
   show up on the Client tab list.

Adding a Primary Contact to a Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The body of the Client form consists of as many contacts as you care to add.
There's no real limit. Further, you can specify which of the contacts is the
primary contact. This will be the person whose details will appear in the main
Client page table list of Clients and the contacts. You can also specify each
contacts specific particulars, such as their personal contact numbers,
mobile/cell-phone numbers, email addresses, as well as their physical address,
if this is different from the main address listed in the Client header record
(perhaps they work from a branch-office.)

Adding Notes to a Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/client_comment.png

   Add as many free-form comments as you need to a Client record. Just click
   the "New+" link in the top right hand corner.

allocPSA provides the facility to add Client-level status notes to your
Project. To do so, simply add text into the 'New Comment' field and click on
the 'Save Comment' button. You can review any existing comments by selecting
them from the comments list, and also update and delete them when they are in
view.

Adding Documents to a Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/client_upload.png

   You can upload documents like images, database files, contracts, etc.


allocPSA allows you to add electronic documents to a Client's record. These
documents could be contracts, letters, scanned images, business-plans, or
database files. All forms of electronic document are supported (PDF files,
ASCII, HTML, all graphics files, MS Word, Powerpoint, Excel and OpenOffice.org
to name but a few.) These documents are then displayed in a list on the
Project page, and can be downloaded or viewed very easily and quickly.
Further, if your web-browser is able to, it will either display the uploaded
document within the browser, or launch a helper application to display the
document on screen, which greatly facilitates easy retrieval and viewing.

To add a document to the Project document 'tree', you can click on the 'Choose'
button which is visible on the Client page. This will bring up a File
Open-style dialog box (depending on your web-browser) with which you can
navigate to the document that you want to upload to allocPSA's document
repository. When you have selected the file you want to upload, and are back to
allocPSA's Project page, you should see the file path specified in the
file-upload textbox. You can then click the 'Save Document' button, and your
web-browser will upload the file to allocPSA. This process may take a moment,
particularly if you have a large file.

Adding Reminders to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a new reminder to the Client Project (rather than to just a
specific Task) by clicking on the 'Add Reminder' link on the Client page.

.. figure:: images/new_reminder.png

   Remainders can even be linked to Clients

Reminders are a wonderfully useful facility in allocPSA. They can be set within
the context of a Client, rather than a Project or Task.

Listing and Adding Projects to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the existing, and add new projects to this client, by clicking
into the Projects tab. This will show you the current, pending and archived
projects related to this client. You can also create a new project, linked to
this client, by clicking the New Project link, and then completing the
process required to add a new project.


Listing and Adding Invoices to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use allocPSA to generate and manage your invoices to clients, you can
manage these from the client's Invoices tab.  This will show you a list of
invoices related to this client, and by clicking the New Invoice link, you will
be able to add a new invoice to this list.


Listing and Adding Sales to Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the existing, and add new sales entities to this client, by
clicking into the Sales tab. This will show you all the sales related to this
client. You can also create a new sale item, linked to this client, by clicking
the New Salelink, and then completing the process required to add a new sale.

Finding the Client Address on a Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA has been integrated with Google Maps, so you are able to jump straigh
to any client address, by clicking on the View map link, shown on the main
Client page. This will take you straight to the nominated client address, as
rendered by Google maps.

Modifying Client Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to modify the Client header information:

1. Click the 'Client Name'.

2. Click the 'Edit Client Details' button to modify the Client header details
   such as name, address etc.

3. Click on the 'Save' button.

4. You can also modify the content you want to change or add for the other
   parts, and press appropriate 'Save' or 'Add' buttons


Projects
--------

.. figure:: images/project.png

   A Project's header information.

A Project is a logical entity which is constituted by one or more
people/resources/personnel working on one or more Tasks. Most Professional
Services firms have very specific examples of what constitutes a Project. It
might be implementing a new computer system for their own use or for a Client.
It might be in the production of a report, or the development of a new device
or item of software. allocPSA is very flexible in terms of how it handles the
concept of a Project, and how the life-cycle of a Project is handled in your
organisation.

To see a list of Projects in allocPSA, click on the Projects tab on the
main menu. This will show you a tabulated view of (most likely) the
currently active projects.

You can filter the list of projects shown in the Projects tab page, by
clicking the Show Filter link, if this is presented, which will open up
the filter segment of the page. Using this filter, you can select to
filter projects by Status (Current, Potential, Archived), Type (Project,
Job, Contract), allocated to a particular person, and portions of a
project's name.

Once you have selected the filter criteria, you click the Filter button,
and allocPSA will show you the matching entries. You can remove a
filter, by clearing out the values in the filter text boxes, and
clicking the Filter button once more.

Much like a Task, a Project has a header component, which is not likely to
change that frequently. Within this header component are informational details
about a the Project, including the Project's name, who the Client is,
Project-specific details about the Client's contact person, a number of start
and finish dates, along with Project budget details, Project manager (for
Time Sheet sign off purposes) and a Project modification history. 

Once the header has been defined and saved, you will be able to set any
per-Project assignment of Commission (used for tracking revenues to account
managers of salespeople within your firm.) You can also establish which
resources/personnel are assigned to work on this Project. Unless a resource is
assigned to a Project, they will not be able to view it or its attendant Tasks
and phases (unless they have manager security privileges.) When establishing
the staff resources who will work on this Project, you can also specify what
their charge rates are to be. 

allocPSA allows for the flexible management of in-house per-Project rates, as
well as externally charged rates which then bring revenues into particular
staff, Project or departmental cost-centres (known as Tagged Funds or TFs).

allocPSA also allows you to upload (and attach) any type of electronic document
to this Project's repository, as well as establish Project-specific Reminders.

The header information which can be specified, is listed below:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Name
     - The name of this particular Project. Provide a name which is reasonably
       memorable clearly understandable and readable . Doesn't matter if it's
       a little long.
   - - Short Name
     - If the Project Name is long and can be contracted or acronymised,
       provide a short name for easy reference here.
   - - Comments
     - A detail account of what this Project is all about This makes it easy
       for new resource to quickly get up to speed with the Project, and can
       help staff who are on dozens of similar Projects quickly identify the
       aims and deliverables of this particular Project.
   - - Priority
     - Specify a priority (used for prioritisation sorting.) Level 1 is the
       highest priority in allocPSA
   - - Status
     - Which should be either Current, Potential or Archived. Only Current
       Projects are displayed by default to users of allocPSA. Potential
       Projects are still being pitched for, and Archived Projects are
       available for review, but aren't active.
   - - Type
     - Which should be either Contract, Job or Project. Most Professional
       Services firms perform work on either a Contract (support contract,
       long-term ongoing work or staff on-site basis), Job (short term work or
       consultancy) or Project (multi-person, with specified beginning, middle
       and end, and more likely to be fixed cost and on a timeline with
       milestones and deliverables.) If you select a Project, allocPSA
       establishes a number of boilerplate phases, which you can use, extend
       or delete as you deem fit. 
   - - Client
     - The name of the Client which may have already been added to allocPSA's
       Client database, or ,if new, can be added by clicking "New Client".
       Remember, many Projects and jobs are for internal Clients. As such,
       your internal Clients should be added in allocPSA's Client database
       too,
   - - Client Contact 
     - The Client's contact representative. This is on a per-Project basis,
       which may be different from the main contact(s) listed in the Client
       database.
   - - Target Start
     - The estimated date you plan to start the Project
   - - Actual Start
     - The actual date you started the Project
   - - Target Completion
     - The estimated date you plan to finish the Project
   - - Actual Completion
     - The actual date you finished the Project
   - - Project Budget $
     - You can set the Project Budget amount here using different currency
       such as AUD, USD, NZD, CAD etc. This figure is used to determine the
       percentage of Project budget which has presently been spent, which is a
       useful metric for Project managers and the professional service firm's
       management. For example, if only half the Project has been completed,
       and 60%of the budget has been spent thus far, there are likely to be
       budget constraint or blow-out problems further down the track.
   - - Cost Centre TF
     - If this Project has an associated Project cost-centre, either
       specifically established for the purposes and life-cycle of this
       Project, or a more generic one, to be used by multiple Projects which
       are thematically linked, this cost-centre can be specified here.

After you have finished all the details:

1. Press the 'Save' button to create your new Project and then..

2. Add resources and add new comments for Modification History, Commission
   To, Project People, uploading Project Files, creating a New Task, adding
   Reminders or generating New Time Sheets, Transactions.

A Project is constituted by one or more people/resource undertaking numerous
Tasks. Tasks can be active (i.e. not-complete) or archived (i.e. completed).
Normally, allocPSA's Project page will only show you the current (i.e. active
and non-complete) Task list. You can elect to see the complete Task list, or
the Project's Task Graph or the Task Allocation Report. A Project will also
allow you to specify people/staff/resource, commissions and attach documents,
which we will see how to manage later on.

Adding Notes to your Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA provides the facility to add Project-level modification history notes
to your Project. To do so, simply add text into the New Comment field and click
on the 'Save Comment' button. You can review any existing comments by selecting
them from the comments list, and also update and delete them when they are in
view.

Project Sales Commission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In many professional services organisations, sales commissions are often
allocated for the business development efforts. In allocPSA, these sales
commissions are tracked on a per-Project basis. Each Project has the facility
for the Project's owner to establish one or more staff/resources from your
organisation, who will receive the sales commission. To add a percentage
commission to a specified staff member, select their name from the drop-list at
left, then add the 'Commission %' in the text-box, then click on the 'Add'
button. This will add that staff member as a commission holder in this Project.
You can add more staff-members as commission-holders by following this simple
procedure.


Adding Staff Resource to your Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/project_people.png

   The people/resource related to the Project can be added or deleted according to your need

You can add as many people/resource to your Project as you wish. To do so,
simply move the page down to the 'Project People' segment of the Project form,
which may show existing resources who have been added to the Project. You will
note that the last-most row (also possibly the first row, if only one row
exists) of the resource entries has a blank selected in the 'Person' drop-list.
You can select the person you wish to add, the type of email notifications they
will receive for this Project: none, only for Tasks assigned to them, and if
this person is the Project's manager, perhaps for all Project Tasks.

Complete Task List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This shows the total list of existing Tasks for this particular Project. Even
completed (i.e. archived) Tasks are shown.

To view this list, click on the 'Tasks' link in the Project you are in. You
will be shown a (possibly long) list of Tasks, which you can click on
individually, to view and edit. You can always return to the normal Project
view by clicking the Back button on your browser or clicking on the
'Project' link at top.

Task Graph - Project Task Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is like the Complete Task List, but also includes a graphical
representation of the timeline of the Tasks and Phases, as well as a list of
the existing Tasks for this particular Project. It can be used as a very simple
facsimile of a Gantt chart for planning purposes. As with all things in
allocPSA, you will always able to print this page to any printers you have
configured to work from our workstation. 

To view this list, click on the 'Graph' link in the Project you are in.
You will be shown a (possibly) large graph with coloured lines, and a
(possibly) long list of Tasks, which you can click on individually, to view and
edit.

The graph shows dates and the names of the Tasks and phases along the left-hand
side. There are 8 separate pieces of information shown on the graph, including
the:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Target Task Period
     - The Target Task Period is a period of time you set for the Task
       completion, from start to finish.
   - - Actual Task Period
     - The Actual Task Period is the actual time you use to complete that
       particular Task, from start to finish.
   - - Forecast Task Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your Task completion, based on percentage
       complete estimates, the date duration spent thus far, and the number of
       hours allocated to this Task.
   - - Start Date (completion date not known)
     - This is a right-heading triangle showing the starting date of the Task
       or phase which has no completion date set. Therefore no target, actual
       and forecast period will be shown.
   - - Completion Date (start date not known)
     - This is a left-heading triangle showing the completion date of the Task
       or phase without any start date having been set. Again, no target,
       actual and forecast period will be shown.
   - - Target Phase Period
     - The Target Phase Period is a period of time you set for the entire phase
       completion. It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Actual Phase Period
     - The Actual Phase Period is the actual time you use to complete the
       entire phase. . It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Forecast Phase Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your phase completion. allocPSA will attempt to
       mathematically estimate the forecast completion phase period based on
       the time and percentage complete estimates supplied within its child
       Tasks.

The Project's phases and Tasks are then shown in a list below the graph. The
child Tasks of any parent Task or phase are shown indented below that parent.
Clicking on any of these will bring it to the screen.


Task Allocation Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report works in a manner very similar to the Task Graph. The difference
being that each individual user/resource's allocation of Tasks are listed and
displayed in their own separate graphs. You can use this report to determine
where possible overload work situations might arise for specific
people/resources on your Projects.

To view this list, click on the 'Allocation' link in the Project you are
in. You will be shown one or more large graphs with coloured lines, and a
possibly long list of Tasks, which you can click on individually, to view and
edit.

Each allocPSA user/resource/personnel who has been allocated to this Project,
has their graph and list of Tasks.

The graph shows the dates along the top, and the names of the Tasks and phases
along the left-hand side. There are 8 separate pieces of information shown on
the graphs, including the:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Target Task Period
     - The Target Task Period is a period of time you set for the Task
       completion, from start to finish.
   - - Actual Task Period
     - The Actual Task Period is the actual time you use to complete that
       particular Task, from start to finish.
   - - Forecast Task Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your Task completion, based on percentage
       complete estimates, the date duration spent thus far, and the number of
       hours allocated to this Task.
   - - Start Date (completion date not known)
     - This is a right-heading triangle showing the starting date of the Task
       or phase which has no completion date set. Therefore no target, actual
       and forecast period will be shown
   - - Completion Date (start date not known)
     - This is a left-heading triangle showing the completion date of the Task
       or phase without any start date having been set. Again, no period shown
   - - Target Phase Period
     - The Target Phase Period is a period of time you set for the entire phase
       completion. It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Actual Phase Period
     - The Actual Phase Period is the actual time you use to complete the
       entire phase. . It uses the dates established within its child Tasks to
       determine these dates.
   - - Forecast Phase Period
     - When the progress for a particular Task or phase tending beyond today's
       date, the system will automatically calculate the completion date as
       well as the period for your phase completion. allocPSA will attempt to
       mathematically estimate the forecast completion phase period based on
       the time and percentage complete estimates supplied within its child
       Tasks.

The Project's phases and Tasks for each specific user/resource are then shown
in a list below the graph. The child Tasks of any parent Task or phase are
shown indented below that parent. Clicking on any of these will bring it to the
screen.


List of the Current Uncompleted Tasks in a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Either from within a Project or from the Tasks view, you can drill down into
those Tasks for a particular Project which are still not complete. These Tasks
may be tracking well or may be overdue. When overdue, allocPSA will flag them
in a brighter colour for obvious recognition.



New Task
~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/task_detail.png

   When adding new Tasks, you first create the Task header
   itself, which specifies the Task name, initial description of the Task,
   start, end dates, estimated hours work etc.

Allows you to create a new Task for this particular Project.

Whenever you are in a Project, and can see the 'New Task' link, click on it to
be presented with a blank new Task screen, which you can then complete, and
submit as per normal. Any Tasks created in this manner will automatically
belong to the Project you are currently viewing.

Adding Reminders to Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a new reminder to the Project (rather than to just a specific Task
or Client) by clicking on the New Reminder link on the Project page

Reminders are a wonderfully useful facility in allocPSA. They can be set
globally, within the context of a Project (so that they cease being sent when
the Project is complete,) and within the context of a Task, (so that they cease
being sent when that Task or its parent Project is complete.) You can set
reminders for yourself, for other resources working on the Project, or for the
whole Project team together (for example, to remind everyone of a Project
meeting, or of a weekly Time Sheet submission policy.)



Uploading Documents to Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA allows you to add electronic documents to a Project. These could be
specification documents, scanned images of signed contracts or manuals. All
forms of electronic document are supported (PDF files, ASCII, HTML, all
graphics files, MS Word, Powerpoint, Excel, MDF files and OpenOffice to name
but a few.) These documents are then displayed in a list on the Project page,
and can be downloaded or viewed very easily and quickly. Further, if your
web-browser is able to, it will either display the uploaded document within the
browser, or launch a help application to display the document on screen, which
greatly facilitates easy retrieval and viewing.

To add a document to the Project document 'tree', you can click on the 'Browse'
button which is visible on the Project page. This will bring up a File
Open-style dialog box (depending on your web-browser) with which you can
navigate to the document that you want to upload to allocPSA's document
repository. When you have selected the file you want to upload, and are back to
allocPSA's Project page, you should see the file path specified in the
file-upload textbox. You can then click the 'Save Document' button, and your
web-browser will upload the file to allocPSA. This process may take a moment,
particularly if you have a large file. 



Adding a Time Sheet to a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most services organisations, Time Sheets are used to co-ordinate the billing
(internally or externally) of staff/resource times and for paying of
staff/resources. As a user of allocPSA who is also entitled to submit
Time Sheets against a Project (and correspondingly, against the cost-centre
associated with that Project,) you can to create Time Sheets from within the
Project in question. Any Time Sheets which are created in this manner are
automatically attached to the current Project. See the Time Sheets section for
further details on how to create and manage Time Sheets.

Project Expense Forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to raise a Project-specific expense, you can create those expenses
with allocPSA's Expense Form (described later in this manual.) All such
expenses will appear on your Project's Transactions section.



Tasks
-----

.. figure:: images/task.png

   A Task can have its specific details, reminders and comments

A Task is a unit of work or a work requirement which needs to be accomplished.
Tasks normally relate to specific Projects. Tasks normally have start and
finish dates. Most Tasks are normally allocated to one specific user (i.e. a user
resource in Project management parlance). Tasks can have associated
descriptions, as well as priorities, and can be part of other Tasks or of
Phases. Tasks can also have a number of user created comments, which can
provide a running history of the Task.

A Task can have Reminders associated with it which can be set to email the
specified owner of the Task, or others within that Project, on certain dates
and at certain times.

Once a Task has been completed, it can be marked off as 100% done. It will then
be archived within the Project, available in a Complete Task List, but not
shown in the normal operational view of the Project. This reduces the overall
clutter.

A Phase is a special kind of Task, whose primary purpose is to contain other
Tasks. Examples of a phases might be 'Documentation' or 'Testing' or 'Planning'
or 'Contract Negotiation'. There is generally little different between a Task
and a phase, except that a phase will be displayed differently in the Task
List when doing a 'List by Project'.

Special Tasks: Faults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In allocPSA a fault is a special kind of Task which can be tracked specifically
as the entity which relates to help-desk activities within allocPSA. 

Outside this change in task 'type', faults are actioned, managed and behave
like any standard task.

Note: When you create a fault, you have the option of establishing an automated
reminder for the assignee. The priority of the fault will determine how
frequently these reminder emails are sent.

While allocPSA does not purport to be a full Service Desk solution, the
tracking of faults as part of the overall system framework provides quite a
powerful system for companies which provide service-level support to track,
manage, filter and archive any issues or problems which arise in the day-to-day
operation of any services organisation. 

Special Tasks: Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In allocPSA a message is a special kind of Task which can be tracked specifically 
as the entity which relates to quick notes for users to take actions, such as calling others.

Outside this change in task 'type', messages are actioned, managed and behave
like any standard task. With one exception. Any messages created for a user,
will appear in a separate Messages segment of the user's Home page.

Note: When you create a message, you have the option of establishing an
automated reminder for the assignee. The priority of the message will determine
how frequently these reminder emails are sent.

General Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks in allocPSA have a number of view. When creating a new Task, you will be
presented with a view which primarily shows the header information. Once this
is saved, and from that point on, viewing that Task should show you the normal
operational view of the Task, with much of the header information now made
read-only. 

You can now process the Task through its normal workflow, by adding comments
upon each atomic action of the Tasks history, updating the percentage complete
and eventually closing the Task off when it's been fully realised or judged
complete. Finally, you can view a Task with its full details displayed on
screen at once (referred to as the printer-friendly view, as its the most
conducive to grabbing a hard-copy snapshot of the Task in totality.



.. figure:: images/task_detail.png

   Task header, allowing you to specify the Project, Task name, description, interested parties and dates.

Tasks have two views. The first view is the header view, where you can
establish a number of attributes which are normally immutable (or change rather
infrequently.) The header view shows only a limited subset of all the
information which is normally associated with a Task. Once you have supplied
whatever information you have and ensured that the Task has a name, you should
then be able to Save the header component, and allocPSA will then take this
information and display it in read-only form, while opening a number of new
attributes which you can now set or change. You may always re-enable editing of
the Task header, by clicking on the 'Edit' link at the top of any
fully-specified Task. 

If you are creating a New Task, or are updating a Task, you may see any of the following data fields:

.. list-table::

   - - Field
     - Attributes
   - - Name
     - The name of this particular Task. Provide a name which is reasonably
       memorable, descriptive and readable
   - - Description
     - A full account of what this Task is about. Provide as much detail as you
       can.
   - - Project
     - Which Project is this Task associated with. 
       Normally left to the default (current) Project, but can be assigned to
       any other Project
   - - Parent Task
     - Select a parent Task (or phase) if this particular Task is a sub-Task.
   - - Priority
     - Specify a priority (used for prioritisation sorting.) Level 1 is the
       highest priority in allocPSA
   - - Assigned to
     - The Person Responsible is the user who is Tasked with undertaking this Task
   - - Task Type
     - Select a Task type; Task, phase, message or fault. A phase is handled
       much the same as a Task, but displayed in different colour in charts.
       Messages and faults are handled differently, Some Tasks or phases are (or have) milestones. For example,
       code releases or document deliverables. As such, they need to be clearly
       displayed as important date-points in online graphs. Setting a milestone
       for this Task will result in a special vertical bar to be drawn in the
       Project Graph.
   - - Interested Parties
     - allocPSA allows you to specify which other members of the Project (which
       the Task belongs to) as well as any Client contacts listed for the
       nominated Project Client, should be included in automated emails which
       are sent. This is a great way to keep a whole team of in-house and
       external resource briefed on the Task status.  NOTE: Naturally, your and
       your staff need to be mindful of what messages are sent to these
       external resources.
   - - Time Estimate Hours (Best/Worst/Expected)
     - Time estimated to finish this Task. It is measured in terms of hour
       units. This figure helps allocPSA produce Project timeline estimates and
       forecasts. It does not need to be the same as the final time effort
       which results in an entry in a Time Sheet.
   - - Time Limit Hours
     - Work that is time sheeted for Tasks that have a Time Limit set will
       be flagged red if they go over their Time Limit Hours.
   - - Percent Complete
     - This is an autocalculated field bases on the Estimated Hours versus the
       Hours that have actually been billed against this Task in the time
       sheet section.
   - - Dates
     - The date of action. It is automatically recorded when you get into this page
   - - Target Start
     - The estimated date you plan to start the Task. Click on the button at
       right to automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and
       to minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01
   - - Actual Start
     - The actual date you started the Task . Click on the button at right to
       automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and to
       minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01
   - - Target Completion
     - The estimated date you plan to finish the Task. Click on the button at
       right to automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and
       to minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01
   - - Actual Completion
     - The actual date you finished the Task . Click on the button at right to
       automatically enter today's date. For International reasons and to
       minimise date-format errors, allocPSA uses ISO date format of
       YYYY-MM-DD. Therefore, the 1st of September 2002 is 2002-09-01

Fill in all the information needed, then press the 'Save' button to create this
new Task. You will then be shown the normal editable Task view which is used
for normal operations on, and updating of Tasks. In general, the header, or top
part of the Task wouldn't need to be modified, but additions can be made to the
Task by way of Comments. You can now add such Comment updates (as they arise)
to this Task, and change the percentage complete status where necessary.

You can add as many comments as you like. All comments will be stamped for
date-time and username. You can also edit (or delete) a comment after it has
been saved, by selecting it from the comments list to display it in the
comments edit box, then updating or deleting it. 


Adding Reminders to Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/new_reminder.png

   Add reminders for you and other members of the Project.

Reminders are a wonderfully useful facility in allocPSA. They can be set
globally, within the context of a Project (so that they cease being sent when
the Project is complete,) and within the context of a Task, (so that they cease
being sent when the Project is complete.) You can set reminders for yourself,
for other resources working on the Project, or for the whole Project team
together (for example, to remind everyone of a Project meeting, or of a weekly
Time Sheet submission policy.) 

Closing a Task When Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have finished all aspects of a Task, you are able to mark it complete.
To do this, click the Edit Task button at bottom of the page, to enable changes
to the task header, and enter a date for Actual Completion. As per-usual, you
can add today's date in the Actual Completion field, by double-clicking on it
with your mouse. Alternatively, you can select one of the Closed options from
the Status drop-list.


Time
----

.. figure:: images/timeSheet_new.png

.. figure:: images/timeSheet_items.png

   Once you've created the Time Sheet header, you can add as
   many items from the Project to that Time Sheet. You can also add comments,
   which will then be added to the Task comment list, and optionally displayed
   with the printed version of the Time Sheet, if not marked private.

The Time Sheet system in allocPSA allows for creation and management of
Time Sheets by users. This Time Sheet system is built around a workflow model
which is established as a 'factory default' when allocPSA is first installed.
This model works as follows. 

1. Time Sheets are created by staff/personnel/resources who have accounts in
   allocPSA

2. Once the Time Sheet has been created and Tasks and hours have been added to
   it, it can be sent to the next person in the workflow queue.

3. Who this next person is depends on a number of factors and default rulesets
   established in the ruleset and configuration of allocPSA when it's
   installed.

4. By default, if the Project in which the Time Sheet was created in has a
   Time Sheet Manager specified, then the Time Sheet will get routed to that
   manager. An email will also be sent to that manager to notify of a pending
   Time Sheet.

5. If this manager verifies all the data and times in the Time Sheet, they can
   elect to send it onwards to the administrative officer, nominally the staff
   member who handles office or financial administration. An email will also be
   sent to that administrative officer to notify of a pending Time Sheet

6. If the manager disputes any of the details in the Time Sheet, the manager can
   add a notice in the Time Sheet, and elect to send it back to the user who
   created the Time Sheet for its rectification and re-submission.

7. If no Time Sheet Manager is specified within the Project, then the Time Sheet
   will automatically be routed to the user who has been specified in the
   configuration of allocPSA as the administrative officer, nominally the staff
   member who handles office or financial administration. An email will also be
   sent to that administrative officer to notify of a pending Time Sheet

8. If the administrative officer disputes any of the details in the Time Sheet,
   the administrative officer can add a notice in the Time Sheet, and elect to
   send it back to the user who created the Time Sheet for its rectification and
   re-submission.

9. At any stage, a user has the option of sending an ado-hoc comment, from the
   time-sheet, in a manner similar to comments email sent from tasks.

10. Similarly, a user has the option of sending the contents of this
    time-sheet, as either a PDF or as a HTML attachment, in a manner similar to
    comments email sent from tasks, with attachments. 


Adding New Time Sheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the action 'Quick List' drop list on the allocPSA toolbar, select 'New
   Time Sheet' link.

2. Choose the Project that this Time Sheet belongs to.

3. Fill in 'Billing Note' if any. This could be something like 'Send the
   Invoice relating to this Time Sheet to the Client before the end of the
   month or Internal billing only.

4. Press the 'Save' button to continue or 'Delete Record' to remove any data
   added.

5. Time Sheets are made up of individual line items, pertaining to specific
   Tasks. For instance, you may have worked for 3 hours on one problem (Task
   A), 2 hours on Task B and 1 hour on Task C, all for the one Client.

6. For each Time Sheet line item, fill in Date, Duration, Task and Location.

7. HINT: If the Task you need to link a Time Sheet line item to doesn't exist
   yet, you can create it by clicking on the 'New Task' link.

8. Press the 'Add' button to add each new item.

9. Repeat step 7 to add more line item entries if needed.

10. Press 'Save and Submit' button when done. An email will be sent off to the
    person designated as the next stop in the Time Sheet workflow process.

11. HINT: You can save the Time Sheet as-is, then return to it later on.

12. HINT: You can track the progress of your Time Sheets from the 'Time Sheet'
    section of your 'Homepage'.

13. HINT: If you're a manager designated to receive requests to authorise
    Time Sheets, you can view them from the 'Time Sheet' section of your
    'Homepage'.

Any submitted Time Sheet is and sent to either the Manager specified in the
Project or to the financial Admin person as specified in the allocPSA
configuration, for approval and to perhaps be Invoiced. 

**NOTE:** You can, at any point, elect to send comment email to others, and even attach this time-sheet to that email. For information on this, see How do I Email a Time-Sheet to Customers? How_do_I_Email_a_Time-Sheet_to_Customers_ 

Printing Time Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the links in the top right hand corner to generate a PDF version of
the Time Sheet which conforms to Australian government standards for Tax
Invoices.

Adding a Time Sheet within a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also add a Time Sheet from within a Project.

1. To create a new Time Sheet, enter the Project which you want to add the
   Time Sheet to.

2. Enter the details and add a Time Sheet header.

3. Add individual Time Sheet items, specifying charge rates, durations, dates
   and locations.

Reviewing Existing Time Sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also review existing Time Sheets you've created. 

1. From the toolbar, click on the 'Time Sheet' link.

2. Decide on what Project, Status, Date From you want to filter within.
   Normally the results page will show those Time Sheets with edit status only.
   Choose All if you want to see all of them. Users with Admin or Manager
   privileges are able to see other people's Time Sheets by selecting the right
   'User Name'.

3. Press the 'Filter' button

4. Click on the Time Sheet you want to edit

5. Complete the details needed.

6. When complete, save or submit the Time Sheet as per usual.

Because Time Sheeting is complicated, we've added special help links for
reminders on the page.


Invoices
--------

.. figure:: images/invoice_new.png

   To create a new Invoice select a Client and click the Create Invoice
   button.

.. figure:: images/invoiceItem_new.png

   Once you've created the Invoice header, you can add as
   many Invoice line items as you like to that Invoice. 


Adding New Invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Invoice system in allocPSA allows for the creation and management of
Invoices by Financial Administrators. This Invoice system is built around a
workflow model which is established as a 'factory default' when allocPSA is
first installed. This model works as follows. 

1. Invoices are created by allocPSA Admin Users

2. Once the Invoice has been created and Invoice line items have been added to
   it, a PDF can be generated and downloaded for it.

   HINT: Invoice items can be generic, and/or can be tied directly to a
   Time Sheet by clicking the "From Time Sheet" button, and/or invoice items can
   be tied directly to Expense Forms by clicking the "From Expense Form" button.

   HINT: Only Time Sheets at status "Invoice" will appear in the "From Time
   Sheet" Invoice item select box.

   HINT: Only Expense Forms that have their "Seek Client Reimbursement"
   checkbox ticked will appear in the "From Expense Form" select box.

3. When you have downloaded and emailed the PDF to your Client, you can click
   the Approve/Reject button. To mark that this Invoice is waiting to be approved
   or rejected (ie the Client has paid, or is not going to pay it).

4. When the Client lets you know if the Invoice has been paid (or isn't going
   to pay), you can mark each Invoice item as Not Going To Be Paid, In
   Dispute, or Paid. You can also mark how much was Paid of each Invoice item by
   editing the amount.

5. Once you have clicked the radio buttons to nominate the payment status of
   each Invoice item, you must click the save button. The colour of the Invoice
   item boxes will change to green if the item was Paid, or Red if it wasn't paid.

   After clicking save a new TF transaction will be created for each Invoice
   item. This transaction reflects the input of funds from the Client. 

6. Once all Invoice items have been marked off you can click the button to
   move the "Invoice to Completed".

   HINT: If you had any Invoice items that were generated "From Time Sheets"
   or "From Expense Form", then the associated Time Sheet or Expense Form will
   have its transactions marked as Paid or Rejected (depending on the status of
   the associated Invoice item) and be moved to status Completed once the
   Invoice is moved to status Completed. 


Reviewing Existing Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can review existing Invoices you've created. 

1. From the toolbar, click on the 'Invoices' link.

2. Decide on the criteria by which you want to filter your list of Invoices
   and click the Filter button. Only users with Finance Admin permissions are
   able to see the full totals of Invoices. However users can see Invoices which
   contain Invoices related to their Time Sheets, or Expense Forms.

3. Click on the Invoice number of the Invoice you want to review.


Sales
-----


Workflow Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

allocPSA allows you to add Products and specify Fixed Costs and/or Percentage
Commissions to be auto-generated for any Sales of a particular Product.

1. An allocPSA user who has "manager" or "admin" permissions creates a Product
   and sets up any related Product Costs or Commissions.

2. At some point in the future a manager or admin creates a Sale for a
   Product. They can specify if the Sale is related to a particular Client or
   Project.

3. That manager or admin finalizes the Sale items that are on the Sale and
   moves the Sale to status Allocate.

4. That same manager or admin should then review the allocation of the *pending*
   transactions for each Sale item. The "Total Unallocated" figure should be green
   and equal to zero. This indicates that all the funds from the Sale have been
   allocated. When they are satisfied they should push the Sale to status
   Administrator.

5. The Administrator should then review the Sale to ensure that everything is
   correct and, once satisfied, should *approve* all the transactions and finally
   move the Sale to status Finished.


Fixed Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed Product Costs are the list of monetary transactions that will be created
whenever this Product is sold. They specify a particular amount that will be
transferred between TF's, and may be used to represent certain known expenses
that are generated every time there is a Sale of this Product.


Percentage Commissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Product has a Buy Cost (the amount that you pay to acquire the item), and
a Sale Price (the amount that you charge the customer). The difference between
these two amounts is the Margin/Profit of the Sale.

The margin/profit from each sale can be distributed based on any Percentage
Commissions that you set up. For example you might specify that 10% of the
profit from each Sale of a particular Product, should go to Alice, perhaps for
a finders fee.


Meta TF's
~~~~~~~~~

When specifying the Product Costs and Commissions, it is possible to select
from the various particular TF's that the transactions should occur between.

There are also Meta TF's that may be auto-calculated for each sale. There is
the "Meta: Project TF", which defaults to the relevant Project (if any), TF. If
no project is specified as part of this Sale, then this Meta TF will fall back
to whatever you have specifed as the "Main Finance TF".

The "Meta: Salesperson TF" allows you to specify transactions that should occur
for the TF of the person who created the Sale. This gives you an easy way to
set up a commission for the person who makes the Sale.


Including or Excluding Tax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When first setting up a Product you may select whether the Sale
Price is inclusive or exclusive of Tax. The Tax amount is the percentage
specified on the Setup screen.

If Sale Price is including Tax, then when a Sale is
made a separate transaction will be created for tax, and the corresponding
margin/profit for that Sale will be smaller.


Default Sale Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Product Sale: [PRODUCT] 

   The amount that is incoming from the customer who purchased the
   Product, i.e. the Sale Price. And it will transfer monies from the
   Incoming TF to the Sale's related Project TF (or if no Project is
   related, then it will fall back to the Main Finance TF).

2. Product Sale Tax: [PRODUCT]

   If Tax is included in the Sale Price, then another transaction will be
   created representing the transfer of the tax amount from the related Project's
   TF (or if there is no related Project, then the Main Finance TF) into the
   nominated Tax TF.

3. The other transactions that are created are from the Product Costs and
   Commissions that were set up for each Product.



Allocation Figures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each Sale Item on the Sale, a summary box is presented that allows you to
quickly check that all the figures for this item are correct.

.. list-table::

   - - Transactions Outgoing
     - The sum of the transactions that are for the Outgoing TF.
   - - Transactions Incoming
     - The sum of the transactions that are for the Incoming TF. This amount should be the same as the Sell Price.
   - - Transactions Other
     - The sum of the other transactions (not including Tax transactions). This amount should be the same as the Margin.
   - - Total Unallocated
     - The difference between the Margin and the Transactions Other. This amount should be zero.

If all the figures line up and reconcile then this Sale is ready to be
progressed. Otherwise the admin or manager should review this Sale and adjust
the transactions until the figures reconcile correctly.



People
------

People for higher lever user: Provide general information of each personnel.
This includes Name, Last Login, Availability, Task Summary, Graph and On Leave.
It comprises also the function of sending email to any personnel

For both higher and lower level users: Allow Changes of your personal
information including Preferred Payment TF, Skill and Absence Forms etc.

1. Availability and On Leave are firstly displayed on the front page

2. If you want to see other information like Task Summary, Graph, Skill Matrix
   etc., simply click the link to get into the detail

Filter Section is the same as that in Tools - Miscellaneous Tools - Company
Wide Skill Matrix. You can have a look at the detail under the section
mentioned in the later part

You can now change your personal information as well as add or view your
absence from, and allocPSA will take you to this


Wiki
----

The Wiki in allocPSA is a user-generated knowledgebase and communal
book. Its interface and syntax will be familiar to anyone who has
created or managed documentation or content on a wiki on similar content
systems.

After clicking the Wiki tab from the main tab menu, you will be
presented with WIKI TREE content block, which sits on the left-hand side
of the screen. This shows the current documents available in the wiki,
along with any folders/sub-folders/directories. You can select any of
the content items, or folders, by clicking on them.

On the right is the HISTORY content block, which will present a list of
change actions for the selected content item/wiki page.

In the middle is the wiki display area, which will show the marked-up
wiki page rendering of your selected content item. You can click on any
wiki page from the WIKI TREE, and it will appear here.

To edit the wiki content item, click the 'Edit' button just beneath the
content display area. This will open the content item in a text-editing
area, and present a simple wiki-text markup toolbar across the top of
this area.

You can now add or modify the content text as you like. If you're
familiar with wiki syntax, you can insert it directly. Alternatively,
you can use the markup toolbar to insert the markup syntax into the text
area. You can also start by using the toolbar to insert items, and learn
the wiki syntax as you progress - it's quite simple.

As an example, to enter text as a top-level heading, click the *H1*
toolbar button. This will insert sample marked-up heading text in the
current cursor position in the text editing area, and highlight the
sample text which you will need to replace with your own. 

You may also notice that many of toolbar buttons have keyboard
accelerators - simply hover your mouse cursor over one of these buttons
to see the corresponding help tooltip. For example, the *H1* toolbar
button uses the Ctrl + 1 keyboard accelerator. *H2* uses Ctrl + 2, etc.
To insert **bold** text, you can use Ctrl + B, *italic* is Ctrl + I and
so forth.

You can preview the changes you've made, without having to commit them,
by clicking the *Preview* toolbar button. The preview page will be
presented below your text-editing area.

Once you've added your first markup, you can continue with your editing,
adding additional content and markups. 

When done, you can save your changes by clicking the 'Save' button just
below your text editing area. 

Also, you should always consider adding a few words of text explaining
the nature of your changes to this wiki page. Add these in the
single-line text box, just below the wiki page text editing area.

Once you've saved your modified wiki page, you will be shown a rendered
version, and the modification note outlining the nature of the changes
will appear in the HISTORY section on the right, along with the name of
the allocPSA making the changes (i.e., you) and the date-time of this
change.

Note that to make the HISTORY functionality work, you will need to have a
file version control system installed on the server. Currently allocPSA
supports git, mercurial or darcs for its VCS. Out of the box allocPSA is
configured to try and use git. The config option called wikiVCS controls which
VCS is used.

Creating a New Wiki Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the *New File* link in the top right hand corner of the wiki
screen; you can also create a new file by linking to a file that doesn't
exist, using the wiki-page link syntax: e.g., [[newfile.txt]] 


Wiki Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~

The wiki syntax used in allocPSA is called *markdown* You can get more
information about how to write markdown wikis here: 
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

We've added some additional extensions to cover syntax for links and
maps.

Here's a quick primer on *markdown*:

- Headings of various levels can be made by following the heading title
  with an 'underlining' line of characters, such as: ~, -, _, etc.

- Words can be *italicised* (i.e., emphasised) by putting a single
  asterisk on either side of the word.

- Words can be **bolded** (i.e., strongly-emphasised) by putting
  double-quotes on either side of the word.

- Links can be made to other wiki pages, by putting the file-name of the
  target wiki page in double-square-brackets: i.e., [[ ]]



allocPSA has been written such that any programmer can "drop-in" a new
wiki syntax. At the moment, the code needs to be modified in order for
this to happen. The allocPSA development team hopes to eventually make
it easy to make this change via a config option.


Inbox
-----

allocPSA provides a facility for accessing the current Inbox for the
primary account used to sent mail to the gateway. 

Normally, this Inbox contains all the mail incoming into allocPSA, which
allocPSA then processes and remove from the Inbox. However, there are
occasions when that email can't be properly processed by allocPSA, such
as when there are no identifying mechanisms in the email header (e.g, a
missing 'key'). Under these circumstances, email isn't processed, and
accumulates in the Inbox. The allocPSA Inbox tool exists to allow an
allocPSA super-user administrator to manage this accumulated mail,
manually.


Inbox Table
~~~~~~~~~~~

The allocPSA mail Inbox is presented as a table, with a number of data
columns:

.. list-table::

   - - ID
     - The message ID as indicated by the mail server
   - - New
     - Indicates if this is new email, not having been opened yet.
   - - Date
     - Indicates the date the mail was sent.
   - - Email
     - Displayes who the mail is from, along with the Subject: line.


Arching, Creating New Tasks and Attaching Emails to Existing Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
There are also a number of Action buttons, which allow you to perform
actions on each of the emails:

.. list-table::

   - - Archive
     - Clicking on this will cause that mail item to be archived, into
       a separate mail folder.x
   - - New Taskx
     - Clicking on this will extract information from that mail, to turn
       it into a new ticket. The Task ID for the new ticket is provided
       in the informational response, given at the top of the Inbox
       page.x
   - - Existing Task
     - This will provide a mechanism for you to nominate an existing
       Task ID that this email relates to, along with a choice of which
       group of people should receive this new material by way of a new
       comment email thread (default interested parties, internal
       interested parties or no interested parties.) Once done, pressing
       the Go button will route this message accordingly, attaching it
       to the nominated task in the process.



Tools
-----

In general, most of the tools on this tab provide additional management and
resource information, allow for customisation and offer your firm a framework
into which you can add your own, site-specific add-ons to your organisation's
allocPSA server.

The Finance section is the gateway to most of allocPSA's finance modules.
It contains reasonably complicated functions which most users don't need to
access. In general, only the user's TF account and Expense Forms need to be
accessed by regular/employee users.

Part of almost any professional services organisation is the management of the
finances associated with the Projects and Tasks which constitute the daily
operations of the organisation. As a Professional Services Automation system,
allocPSA includes a modular and flexible finance management system whose
purpose is to provide the conduit for any and all financial transactions with
the professional services organisation's accounting software. As such, allocPSA
offers the necessary modules to conduct financial transactional activities
within allocPSA (for Time Sheets, for Project-related Expense Forms etc) as well
as a shadow of many of the financial transactional activities which are found
in standard modern business accounting systems, such as invoicing, cost-centre
and wages management. As with many other aspects of allocPSA, non-privileged
users will be shown a simplified view of the Finance section, while managers and
administrative users will see the full offering.

Reminder: A Tagged Fund (TF) is an allocPSA term referring to the per-Project,
per-group/division or per-staff-member cost-centre which is tracked and managed
by allocPSA.

Non-privileged users will be offered these items: TF List, New Expense Form,
Search Invoices, View Pending Expense Forms and Search Transactions. Privileged
users can also see the following items: Approve Invoices, Allocate Invoices,
New Transaction, Upload Expenses File, New TF, Push
Repeating Expenses Through, Upload Wages Files, Reconciliation Report, View
Pending Transaction.


Finance 
~~~~~~~



New Tagged Fund
```````````````

.. figure:: images/tf_new.png

   You can create new TF cost-centres for Projects, staff or
   for any other purpose.

When new staff or Projects that need a corresponding TF cost-centre are added
to allocPSA, you can create such accounts from this section of the Finance
area. By default, for staff cost-centres, allocPSA uses a standard Payroll ID
based on a product call QuickPayroll, part of the QuickBooks accounting system.
This number would need to be reconfigured for your site's specific requirements
and accounting software. The instructions below would generally apply however.

1. Fill in the contents of the form which include TF Name, Quick Payroll
   Employee Number, Quicken Account Name, Comments, and Last Modified by.

2. Press the 'Save' button to save your work

3. Click 'Return to TF List' to return to the TF List page.

This new account will have been automatically added to the TF account list.


List of Tagged Funds
````````````````````

allocPSA has the ability to track internal cost-centres (or Tagged Funds, known
within the program as TFs) for expenses and revenues related to Projects, staff
and business units.

If you are a normal user, a TF is your personal cost-centre account. The TF is
the account into which Time Sheet payments are made (credited) and from which
expense items are taken out of (debited) upon reimbursements.

If you are a manager, you may also be shown any TF cost-centres which have been
allocated to you (among possibly other managers users) to manage.

Within the TF List page, there are:

1. TF Name

2. Description

3. Balance and

4. Three specific action, namely 1. Statement 2. Repeating Expenses and 3. Edit
   TF (lower level user does not have the item Edit TF)

Statement shows all the information of your payment. They are as follows:


New Transaction
```````````````

.. figure:: images/transaction.png

   Transaction detail view

This facility allows for the insertion of new ad-hoc transactions into any
Project or staff TF cost-centre account.

Fill in the fields as per the fairly detailed descriptions and then press any
of the various 'Save' buttons. The new transaction will automatically be added
to that specific TF cost-centre account.


Search Transactions
```````````````````

This facility allows you to search through the Transactions recorded in
allocPSA, using a variety of search options.

There are a number of ways to search the transaction database stored within
allocPSA:

1. Firstly, you can choose the cost-centre TF of any Project or staff member,
   from the drop list.

2. You can also select the status of the transactions from the drop list.
   Options include All, Pending, Rejected and Approved.

3. You can supply the period sought through dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.

4. You can also enter the Transaction ID or Expense Form ID directly.

You can also apply the various search criteria in combinations. allocPSA will
search the database and return a list of matching records.


.. figure:: images/statement.png

   A cost-centre is like an internal bank account. You can review its contents much like you would any online bank account.

A user with higher privileges can drill down into the the transactions by
clicking on any 'ID / Invoice Numbers' links will show you the Invoice details. 

Repeating Expenses can let user create an expense that repeats on a fixed
basis. All that needs to be done to process the next cycle is for the financial
Admin user to press the New button, which creates the repeating transaction.

Privileged users can view all TFs by clicking the 'Edit TF' link associated
with each TF account.


New Expense Form
````````````````

Expense forms can be created in allocPSA to better represent the Project
accounting costs associated with each Project. For instance, if additional
laptops are needed in order to meet certain Project deliverables, then the
costs for these laptops should be borne by that Project. 

To create a once off expense, follow the instructions below:

1. From the allocPSA toolbar, click on the 'Finance' tab.

2. From the Finance page, click on the 'New Expense Form' link.

3. Select your payment options and click the 'Create Expense Form' button.

4. Add your expense(s) by completing the details. Specify the
   supplier you purchased from, and what was purchased, the date, unit cost and
   number of units.

5. Click 'Add To List' and repeat the previous step if necessary, adding as
   many items, from as many suppliers as needed.

6. Click the 'To Admin' button when you want to submit this Expense Form.

7. In general, you may want to print a hardcopy of this form, so you can
   attach expense receipts or Invoices for taxation purposes. You can do this
   by clicking on the 'Printer Friendly Version' in the top right-hand corner.


View Pending Expenses
`````````````````````

This facility allows you to view the Pending Expense Forms allocated to the TF
cost-centre accounts you manage. This information provided includes the expense
form ID, when it was Last Modified, who it was last Modified By, the Payment
Method and Form Total.

1. Click the ID link you want and go into the detail of the expenses form. You
   will access the same page as New Expense Form.

2. Follow the instructions and then press the 'Save' button to commit those
   changes.


Upload Wages File
`````````````````

Allows for the uploading of wage transaction files into TF Cost Centres,
normally in Quicken Interchange Format QIF text format, from your accounting
system.

1. Enter the file name in the space provided, or

2. Press the 'Browse' button to search the file

3. Press the 'Upload' button after you have chosen the file

allocPSA will now take a few seconds to upload the file and add the data to the
Project accounting system and will then return to the main 'Finance' page when
finish uploading.


New Repeating Expense
`````````````````````

This will let you create an automated transaction creation. You can specify
the regularity and description and TF etc.


Repeating Expense List
``````````````````````

This is a list of all the Repeating Expenses. 


Execute Repeating Expenses
``````````````````````````

Repeating expenses are re-occurring expenses that are created by a scheduled
job that runs once per day. If that job is not run, the repeating expenses may
be manually created by clicking this link.

Click the link to create all repeating expenses that are scheduled to be
created.

Your changes will be automatically updated on the Permission page and activated for all users.


Cost & Time Estimator
`````````````````````

As an example of the kinds of functional extensions that can be made within
allocPSA, the Simple Cost & Time Estimator is provided, and documented here. It
is envisaged that this utility will not be of direct use to most users of
allocPSA. It is hoped that by providing this simple utility as an example, your
organisation will be inspired to visualise and eventually add your own set of
tools which can be used by your staff, to assist in day-to-day  operations at
your organisation.

Based on a set of pre-determined programming and database languages, it is
possible to input various values for the scope and size of a particular
web-based database application, and this Estimator will produce a pre-figured
determination of the best-effort time and cost estimation, along with a spread
of values, based on number of resources. The values generated are based on a
pre-computed seed metric, derived from several years' evaluation of similarly
scoped Projects.



Search
``````

The search functionality within allocPSA searches various fields in the
database and also the files in the wiki. It uses the Zend port of the Lucene
search engine. 

Any of the keyword fields that are indexed may be searched upon. Either by
itself or in combination with other search terms. The default is to search
across ALL keyword fields.

For more information about the Zend search syntax please read this article:
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.query-language.html

Company Skill Matrix
````````````````````

.. figure:: images/skill_matrix.png

   You have the ability to add your own skill types and
   levels, and categorise your resources against those skill types.

This tool allows you to review, filter and drill down into the various
skillsets of your resource list as known by allocPSA. Whilst the samples
provided and screenshots shown display IT-related skills, this module can be
configured to handle any type of skill set.

You can use the first droplist to select a primary (i.e. broad) skill type,
then press the 'Filter' button. You should now be able to drill down into the
sub-categorised skills by selecting from the secondary drop-list, once again
pressing the 'Filter' button. At any stage, you can print the resulting matrix.


Edit Skill Items
````````````````

This tool allows you to add edit and delete the various classes of skill and
abilities from which your organisation draws. Ie in a tech field the Skill
Classes might be Hardware, Software, Networking etc, and the Skill names might
be Harddisks, Optical Drives, Java, etc.


Task Comment Templates
``````````````````````

In allocPSA, Task Comment Templates are used primarily as a form of open-ended
checklist system, allowing particular types of Tasks to be created quickly.

The Templates are created for oft-repeated jobs and Tasks. They can be enacted
when creating new Tasks. 

When creating a new comment for a Task, you have the option
of invoking a pre-existing template for the text comment. This is useful if
there is a set routine or process which the person who has been allocated
the Task needs to undertake. 

Task Comment Templates are create by pressing the 'New Comment/Template' link.
Simply fill in the Name for this new template, and supply the check list
content in the Text section. You can be as detailed as you like. Adding text
which appears like bullet-points is a good idea. When ready, press the 'Save'
button.

You can add new templates, which then become available from
a droplist in new Tasks. These templates can have place-holders, such as

place-holders with real values.

You can also edit and delete a Task Template by select it from the list, making
modifications and pressing the 'Save' button, or pressing the 'Delete' button.

Reports
```````

allocPSA provides an open and flexible way in which you can extract data from
its database. This is managed through the Reports interface.

Reporting allows you to select which tables, fields and criteria you want to
sort and filter data out from your allocPSA database. The data can be displayed
on-screen within the web browser, or bundled into a text-based Comma Separated
Value (CSV) or TAB delimited file, for downloading to your computer. This data
can then be inserted into applications like Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org
Calc (http://openoffice.org/), Crystal Reports, Microsoft Access or other
reporting tools.

1. Click the 'Reports' link on the allocPSA toolbar to go to the Report page.

2. Select which module you want to report on (Clients, Tasks etc.)

3. Press the 'Show Fields' button.

4. allocPSA will now display all the database table fields which pertain to
   that module.

5. If you want to pull data out of any particular field, you need to click its
   corresponding checkbox.

6. If you want to enact any filtering on that field, for instance, in answer to
   the question 'Show me all Clients companies which have names starting with
   the word HyperGlobalMegaNet', you would use the following filter criteria:
   HyperGlobalMegaNet%

7. Alternatively, you can specify number ranges, upper and lower, using the
   supplied numeric criteria fields.

8. Scroll down to the bottom and press the 'Dump Fields' button.

9. This will now dump the resulting records to your browser screen, below the
   fields and selection criteria.

10. You can choose which suitable you use as the 'Group By' aggregator, by
    selecting the choice button next to its title.

11. You can also elect to put quotes around the field data (handy when dealing
    with data which has commas etc.) by selecting the option from the 'Quotes
    around fields' droplist.

12. Rather than dumping the resulting dataset to the browser, you can tick the
    'Generate File' checkbox and allocPSA will supply the resulting dataset in
    the form of a text file.

13. You can also select a number of delimiters, comma (,), TAB (tab),
    double-hash (##) etc, which you can then use to separate your fields when
    you pull them into your report analysis application, or mail-merge
    facility.


Database & File Backup
``````````````````````

allocPSA allows super-users to create database and uploaded file backups, and
then subsequently download, upload or restore a backup file.

1. Click the 'Database & File Backup' link on the allocPSA Tools tab to go to
   the backup page.

2. Click the 'Create New Backup' button.

3. A list of generated backup files will appear, (you can have multiple
   backups).

4. If you click the link for the backup file, you can download the file to
   your computer.

5. If you click the 'Restore' button next to a backup file, that backup file
   will be used to overwrite your current allocPSA database and file uploads. 
   Be careful with this feature. (A backup will be auto-created before all
   'Restore' operations).

6. You can choose to clear up some space by removing a backup file by clicking
   the 'Delete' button.

7. You can download a backup file, unzip it, edit it, zip it back up, and then
   re-upload it using the 'Upload Backup Zip File' button, and then restore that
   newly uploaded backup using the 'Restore' button.

NOTE: Be very careful using this feature. Especially when mixing and matching
different versions of allocPSA as restoring a backup file from an earlier
release of allocPSA onto a new release probably isn't going to work.

NOTE: Sometimes the PHP memory limit of your webserver will need to be
increased to allow for large files and databases.
